These partnerships will enable the airline to tap into and deliver better customer experiences, value and exclusive benefits to diverse customer segments, and seamless access to the airline’s innovative digital solutions. Emirates and the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA), the global hub for the international association meetings industry, have signed a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance collaboration and drive the growth of global business events. This partnership will foster greater synergies between air travel and international meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE). Through this agreement, both organizations aim to facilitate more seamless connectivity for association meetings, support destination development strategies, and empower the global events ecosystem through knowledge exchange and capacity building. The MoU is also aligned with Dubai’s strategic ambitions to assert its position as a world-leading destination for international conferences and reinforces ICCA’s ongoing efforts to engage with key industry leaders in shaping the future of business events. Every year, the city hosts hundreds of major events and conferences, welcoming millions of visitors, and the MICE sector is instrumental in supporting the emirate's D33 economic agenda. Emirates has also signed an MoU with IDP Education to establish a strategic partnership that will enhance the travel experience for students and educators, support their educational mobility, and strengthen the airline’s reach across key education centres in its network. IDP Education is a global leader in international education services, helping students achieve their study abroad goals through a network of over 210 student placement offices across 35 countries. With more than 55 years of experience, IDP has supported hundreds of thousands of students in pursuing their education in top global destinations, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Ireland, and New Zealand. Both organisations will align efforts to boost student accessibility to global study destinations by offering a special fare programme designed for students aged 16 to 31, additional baggage allowance, flexible booking options, and more value-added benefits planned in the next phase of partnership. The partnership will commence for IDP students in the Middle East and North Africa, with plans to scale offers and joint initiatives across key outbound education markets in the airline’s network. Students can access Emirates’ special discounts via the IDP.com website. The airline will also explore logistical support for IDP’s regional and global events, including conferences, fairs, and assessment activities, while leveraging insights to understand travel trends to further adapt the student programme. Emirates and Huawei have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), reinforcing their long-standing partnership focused on digital innovation initiatives that drive visibility for both brands across key global markets. The agreement outlines a broad framework for collaboration between Emirates and Huawei that includes joint campaigns, enhanced media presence, co-branded content, and integrated customer engagement strategies, particularly focused on the Middle East, North Africa, and mainland China. Under the expanded agreement, Emirates will become one of the first airline brands to adopt and launch new Huawei services, including the global release of the HarmonyOS NEXT watch app. Both Emirates and Huawei will continue to work closely to develop the Emirates App on Huawei’s AppGallery platform, ensuring consistency of quality and user experience. The tech powerhouse will aim to drive increased awareness of the Emirates–Huawei partnership across mainland China and the Middle East and North Africa via integrated communications including press events, social media platforms, and media outreach. Huawei will also extend its support to Emirates’ upcoming Shenzhen route launch in July through coordinated promotional efforts.

https://www.executivetraveller.com/emirates-wifi-guide?,Review: Emirates inflight WiFi,2024-03-05,"It’s easy to leave the world behind on international Emirates flights, especially if you’re taking some time out at the superb A380 bar – but you can still keep in touch thanks to the Gulf carrier’s free WiFi service. But there’s a catch: you have to be a member of Emirates’ Skywards frequent flyer program. Even in business and first class, inflight Internet is complimentary only for Skywards members – for everyone else, it can cost USD$3-20 depending on which package you choose. Here’s the rundown: Skywards Blue, Silver, Gold and Platinum members travelling in any class – economy, premium economy, business or first – have free text messaging for their entire flight. This covers apps like iMessage, Facebook Messenger,  WhatsApp, WeChat, Line or Vibe, Skywards Blue, Silver, Gold and Platinum members travelling in first class receive full unlimited Internet access, Skywards Silver, Gold and Platinum members travelling in business class also enjoy full unlimited Internet access, Skywards Platinum members travelling in any class can look forward to full unlimited Internet access. Entering a frequent flyer number from the loyalty program of a partner airline such as Qantas cuts no ice here – it’s Skywards or nothing. Our tip: make sure you have the password to your Emirates Skywards account on hand, because you’ll need this to log into the free WiFi on board. The system has no way to look up your password or to set a new password, and the flight attendants can’t help in this regard. At least without your Skywards login you can still watch live TV streamed from the BBC World Service, CNN International, Sky News Arabia and Sport 24. During a recent Emirates A380 flight from Sydney to Dubai, Executive Traveller found the connection ran at a decent clip: while certainly not zippy, it was far from sluggish: we’d describe it as “usable-with-patience”. A small WiFi icon at top-right of the Emirates WiFi portal window shows how many active users there are at any time, and even when sharing the connection with 30-60 other flyers it held up well. That said, there were certainly times during the flight when for no apparent reason the WiFi connection became slower and slower, to the point of being frustratingly unusable, before it would eventually bounce back to normality. If you don’t hold suitable Skywards status, or have forgotten your password and are thus unable to log in, then you’ll be up for the following: Unlimited text-only chat: USD$3-6 depending on the length of the flight,Unlimited WiFi: USD$10-20 depending on the length of the flight Emirates WiFi FAQs. Does Emirates have inflight WiFi? Yes, Emirates offers sky-high WiFi on practically every flight. Both complimentary access and paid plans are available. Which Emirates flights have WiFi? The entire Emirates fleet is outfitted with inflight internet. No matter whether you are travelling on an Airbus A380 or a Boeing 777, you should be able to browse online while at cruising altitude, bar any technical malfunctions or while flying over restricted zones. Scheduled to enter service in mid-2024, the Gulf carrier’s latest Airbus A350 aircraft will also feature high-speed internet access, in the form of Inmarsat’s Global Xpress (GX) satellite network. How much does Emirates WiFi cost? Paid WiFi plans on Emirates costs vary depending on your Skywards membership tier, travel class and your route. As a guide, the available plans are: Unlimited chat: Connect free to all your favourite text apps (WhatsApp, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Line or Viber) for the whole flight, WiFi for the whole flight: USD $9.99 (AUD $14.50) - USD $19.99 (AUD $29) depending on the length of the flight, Easy connect - available in selected regions: USD $9.99 (AUD $14.50) for 30 minutes with no data limit. Does Emirates have free WiFi? Yes, Emirates has two forms of free WiFi, though both are only available to Emirates Skywards members. The first option is free unlimited chat, which allows Emirates Skywards Blue members travelling in business class or Emirates Skywards Gold members travelling in economy to use WhatsApp, Messenger and other text services for free. For those wanting to access free WiFi for the whole flight, the requirements are as follows:  Passengers travelling in first and business class receive unlimited free WiFi for all Skywards members (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum) In economy passengers, Skywards Gold and Platinum members only receive unlimited free WiFi To take advantage of this offer, you must have your Skywards number linked to the booking at least 24 hours before take-off. Onboard, you’ll use your membership number and password to log-in. How fast is Emirates WiFi? Emirates WiFi speed depends on various factors, the most significant being the number of users connected at one time. Executive Traveller previously ran speed tests onboard and managed to get downloads between 5-10Mbps, with uploads of just over 1Mbps. These speeds are perfectly fine for light browsing. To help judge the current network load, Emirates handily shows the number of people currently connected. A green WiFi icon means speeds should be higher, while a red WiFi icon means speeds may suffer due to the number of people connected. Do I need the Emirates App to use WiFi?

https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-marks-15-years-of-operations-to-senegal/,Emirates' 15th Anniversary in Senegal,2025-09-15,"Over 890,290 passengers transported since 2010. Transported over 18,200 tonnes of cargo in the last 5 years alone. 50+ Senegalese employed by The Emirates Group. Dakar, Senegal, 15 September 2025 – Emirates, the world’s largest international airline, is celebrating 15 successful years of flying to Dakar, Senegal. Since the inaugural flight in 2010, Emirates has played a pivotal role in connecting passengers and trade from Senegal with its vast global network via Dubai. Emirates first began operations to Dakar in 2010, operating an Airbus A340-300 with five-weekly services. This marked the first scheduled air link between the UAE and Senegal, creating a seamless, fast, and convenient service for travellers. Beyond connectivity into the Middle East, the new route significantly improved ease of travel between Senegal, China, and other Asian markets, a boon for traders and the business community. Likewise, the route also enhanced the journey for thousands of pilgrims travelling to the holy city of Mecca for Hajj and Umrah. In 2016, Emirates upgraded the route to a Boeing 777-300ER, expanding the weekly seat count and cargo capacity to bolster connectivity and serve the increased demand. Over the last 15 years, Emirates has operated 6,065 flights and carried over 890,290 passengers to and from the market, forging key inbound traffic from Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing in China; Delhi, Chennai, and Bombay in India; as well as South Africa and Saudi Arabia. The outbound traffic is similar, with destinations such as China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. Commenting on the milestone, Arpit Behl, Country Manager, Senegal, Emirates, said: “Celebrating 15 years of connecting to Senegal reflects the strong ties we have built with our customers, and partners, and our longstanding investment in this important market. Since our very first flight, we have delivered on our promise to enhance connectivity with the globe and provide travellers with a world-class inflight experience. We are proud to have played a key part in Senegal’s evolving aviation, tourism, and trade sectors, and will continue our journey with new and exciting developments for years to come."" Fondly referred to as the Land of Teraanga, Senegalese culture is defined by kindness, generosity, and hospitality – key and in-demand traits amongst Emirates’ multinational Cabin Crew community. The airline employs more than 50 people from Senegal, including cabin crew, pilots, sales agents, and other positions across the Group. Emirates offers candidates exceptional career opportunities, including a wide range of development programs that aim to retain and inspire top talent. Emirates A380 Captain Oumar Ba said, “As a proud Senegalese national, and Airbus A380 Captain for the world’s largest international airline, it’s a pleasure to see Emirates celebrating 15 years of operations to Dakar. I’ve been flying with Emirates for almost 10 years, travelling all over the world – one day, I hope to have the honour of flying the iconic Emirates A380 into Senegal!” Senegal and the UAE have deep-rooted and mutually beneficial bilateral and economic relations, with a significant growth in trade over the last 5 years. Emirates SkyCargo, the airline’s freight division, has played a key role in facilitating global trade with Senegal, transporting over 18,200 tonnes of goods in and out of Dakar in the last five years alone. In addition to the bellyhold capacity in passenger aircraft, the airline operates a once-weekly Boeing 777F freighter into Senegal, boosting the capacity of trade in and out of the region. Leveraging its industry-leading portfolio of fit-for-purpose products, Emirates SkyCargo uplifts key exports such as world-famous Senegalese seafood, transporting it worldwide. Popular shipments include thiof, commonly known as grouper, Daurade (seabream), and Rougets (red mullet), transported to Europe, and lobster into destinations across East Asia. Beyond seafood, Emirates SkyCargo carries seasonal commodities such as beans to European destinations, as well as melons and mangoes into the UAE. Conversely, the airline imports vital commodities such as mobile phones and accessories, textiles and garments, and other electronics mostly from the UAE, Hong Kong, and India, in addition to regular pharmaceutical shipments such as vaccines.",over 890 290 passengers transported since 2010 transported over 18 200 tonnes of cargo in the last 5 years alone 50 senegalese employed by the emirates

https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/the-new-emirates-crew-training-centre-powers-next-gen-aviation-growth/,The new Emirates Crew Training Centre powers next-gen aviation growth,2025-09-16,"Expands Emirates’ yearly pilot training capacity by 54% and 45,000 hours. Designed and built with an investment of US$135 million. Dubai, UAE, 16 September 2025: Emirates announced the opening of its new state-of-the-art flight crew training centre, which aligns with the airline’s strategic growth. The facility will provide current and future pilots training on its fleet of Airbus A350s and its upcoming Boeing 777Xs. The purpose-built and high-tech facility, spanning 63,318 sq. ft., houses six full flight simulator bays. Strategically located near other Emirates training facilities in Dubai, the centre is part of a strong, vibrant aviation hub for employees’ personal and professional growth and development. His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive Emirates Airline and Group, said: “Our new Emirates Crew Training Centre is a gamechanger and has a significant role to play, both in the industry’s ecosystem and Dubai’s emergence as a global aviation hub. Every dirham of our AED 500 million investment is already delivering value. The centre sets new firsts and serves as best-in-class in aviation training, shaping our programmes and preparation for our future fleet. Above all, our pilots and instructors have shared stellar feedback on the new facility and that is immensely rewarding.” Emirates’ pilots have every reason to be thrilled with the new centre. The simulators are integrated with the innovative Pilot Support Station (PSS), an industry first entirely conceptualised in-house, to optimise the training experience. Prior to their training session, pilots can configure their flight deck, even build a flight plan, in a fully immersive environment using bespoke devices. By streamlining preparation, pilots can maximise learning outcomes. Training sessions are fully recorded, enabling instructors to replay any moment to enhance performance review and learning. The centre also boasts sophisticated 3D printing capabilities to create complex components and structures that support Emirates’ training equipment across the campus, generating an impressive annual saving of up to AED 1 million. The centre has commenced training pilots with two A350 full flight simulators. Four more, including Boeing 777Xs simulators, are scheduled to be welcomed in the next couple of years. Each simulator has the capacity to deliver 7,500 hours of training for up to 1,000 pilots every year. Once fully operational, Emirates’ pilots will have access to 17 simulators, including 11 for training on A380s and Boeing 777s. Across all its facilities, Emirates’ capacity will expand by 54%, offering a solid 130,000 training hours to its pilot community every year. Emirates’ first A350 full flight simulator received a Level D qualification, the highest rating for this type of simulator, from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). What’s more, it is the first globally at the latest Airbus A350 Standard 1.3, achieving qualification with zero findings, another rare feat. Pilots at Emirates complete robust, evidence-based and competency-based training programmes with highly skilled instructors. The new Emirates Crew Training Centre also houses four spacious classrooms for facilitating courses in pilot recurrent, conversion and command training. Besides the Emirates Crew Training Centre, the airline offers a range of world-class training and development programmes for its employees and for other aviation professionals. Other facilities in Dubai include the Emirates Flight Training Academy for cadets, Emirates Aviation University, Emirates Cabin Crew Training Centre, and the Emirates Aviation College that offer hundreds of specialist, technical and soft skills courses for its employees and the broader aviation community. Emirates is on a massive growth trajectory and is on the lookout for pilots for its three programmes – Direct Entry Captains, Accelerated Command and First Officers non-type rated. Those aspiring to join the world’s largest international and most profitable airline with the biggest fleets of A380s and Boeing 777s are invited to apply.",expands emirates’ yearly pilot training

https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-and-ageop-ricerca-lift-spirits-of-young-cancer-patients-with-a-heartfelt-initiative-in-bologna/,Emirates and AGEOP Ricerca lift spirits of young cancer patients with a heartfelt initiative in Bologna,2025-09-01,"Bologna, 1 September 2025 – Emirates, the world’s largest international airline, has partnered with AGEOP Ricerca to bring moments of joy and comfort to young cancer patients in Bologna. As part of this initiative, 200 backpacks and activity books have been donated to children receiving treatment at the Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Department of IRCCS Policlinico di Sant’Orsola. AGEOP Ricerca is an independent association that has supported children with cancer and their families since 1982. Young patients from Italy and abroad come to this centre to access therapies that are not readily available in their hometowns. This collaboration reinforces Emirates’ commitment to “connecting communities” by building enduring relationships and making meaningful differences in the destinations it serves. Emirates’ signature children’s backpacks, usually distributed on board to entertain young passengers during their journeys, take on a new and heartfelt purpose: to offer encouragement, familiarity, and a sense of normalcy to children facing challenging times. Flavio Ghiringhelli, Emirates’ Country Manager in Italy, said: “We’ve long sought a project that would allow us to support the local community in a truly meaningful way. We’re especially proud this initiative is taking place in Bologna, where we are celebrating ten years since our first flight to the city. It reflects our deep roots here, and it’s a tangible way of showing the children and their families that they are not alone — that a global community stands with them, even from thousands of kilometres away.” Francesca Testoni, General Director of AGEOP Ricerca, said: “Each and every backpack that Emirates donates to our children and teenagers represents more than the object itself: it is a thought, a kind touch, a sign of attention and interest from those who live beyond the walls of the paediatric oncology hospital. Receiving these backpacks during the summer period has a greater meaning, both for the patients and for us, the ones who take care of them. These are the months during which most people are thinking about their vacations, but paediatric cancer patients unfortunately never take one. There is less support and fewer donations in the summer months and so, knowing that someone is thinking about us and is supporting us, makes the loneliness more bearable. We are very thankful to Emirates who, with this initiative, has enabled us to keep directing our focus and efforts towards these programmes of care — which must not, and cannot ever stop.” The donation aims to ease the hospital routine with moments of enjoyment, particularly during the summer months when opportunities for social connection can be more limited. This simple yet thoughtful gesture reflects Emirates’ broader mission to connect communities not only through its extensive route network, but also through acts of solidarity and care.

In partnership with the Australian Tennis Foundation, Emirates launched its Force for Good program in Australia in 2025 to make a meaningful impact in local communities. In 2025 alone, Emirates’ Force for Good program will support approximately 3,000 disadvantaged children and young people in gaining access to tennis across 11 community initiatives. BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA, 5 September 2025 – On the 4th of September, about 250 primary school students from low socio-economic and multicultural communities joined a free rotational sports day designed to introduce them to tennis, while enhancing their physical and mental fitness. The initiative was one of 11 community tennis initiatives in 2025 to receive funding from the Emirates’ Force for Good program, now in full swing across Australia for the first time this year. Yesterday's sports day, the Schools Future Fit Program, was delivered by Youth of Tomorrow which gained funding from Emirates’ Force for Good initiative earlier this year. Held at the Pat Rafter Arena, Queensland State Tennis Centre, approximately 250 students participated in a series of on-court tennis activities delivered by qualified coaches, including introduction to Pop and Pickleball, and preventative mental health workshops. In celebration of the Force for Good program, Australian tennis legend and Australian Tennis Foundation ambassador, John Millman, joined the students in a series of coaching sessions focused on fun and social connection. Guest appearances were made by Emirates mascots and Emirates cabin crew. Students received a series of tennis gifts and got to capture special moments and create memories with a Polaroid photo in a limited-edition Emirates photo frame as a keepsake. In partnership with the Australian Tennis Foundation, Emirates launched its Force for Good program in Australia in 2025 to make a meaningful impact in local communities. Emirates is investing $2.25 million over five years to inspire brighter futures for disadvantaged children and young people through tennis. The Emirates’ Force for Good program operates in the five Australian cities where the airline flies – Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The community initiatives offer a structured and supportive environment where kids can develop their sporting skills and build social connections, contributing to their physical and mental wellbeing. In 2025 alone, Emirates’ Force for Good program will support approximately 3,000 disadvantaged children and young people in gaining access to tennis across 11 community initiatives. These will include over 60 schools, clubs and other community courts, offering children over 10,000 opportunities to play. Beginning for the first time this year, the Emirates Force for Good program has already been in full swing in Australia, with six community initiatives having already kicked off across Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Sydney, with over 800 participants. Dean Cleaver, Regional Sales Manager at Emirates, said: “Emirates is passionate about ensuring our commitment to Australia extends beyond the flights we operate. For us, the Force for Good program is an opportunity to give back to the communities we serve in Australia. Backed by a legacy of strong sporting sponsorships including our longstanding partnership with Tennis Australia, we know that offering children access to tennis is about more than the game. For children who might otherwise miss out on the opportunity, we’re not only introducing them to a sport, we’re offering pathways to develop physical skills, build social connections, and enhance mental wellbeing. The enthusiasm and fun we saw from the students in Brisbane is exactly what this program is about.” Executive Director, Australian Tennis Foundation, Vicki Reid, said: “We are excited to join forces with Emirates to support social impact initiatives across Australia. Through this collaboration, we can break down barriers and provide young people with the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.” John Millman, tennis legend and Australian Tennis Foundation ambassador, said: “Tennis has the power to bring people together and create lasting change. It’s incredible to see the joy and connection these kids experience when they’re given the chance to play.” Chief Executive Officer of Youth of Tomorrow, Umit Oraloglu, said: “We’re proud to partner with Emirates, ATF and Tennis Queensland to deliver a fully funded program to schools that need it most, supporting both the physical and mental wellbeing of young people.” Emirates' Force for Good program builds on the airline's ongoing commitment to Australia, where it has invested over $230 million in sponsorships, including the Australian Open. The first year of the program will culminate in January 2026 with a special event at the Australian Open.",tennis legend john millman joined 250 primary school students for a free sports day

At the clinic, youth from Kings County Tennis League, who benefited from the programme’s inaugural project at De Hostos Playground in South Williamsburg, had the opportunity to interact with and receive lessons from the two legends. Emirates is the Official Airline of the US Open Grand Slam® tournament and launched the Force for Good programme in partnership with the USTA Foundation in 2024.

To provide the opportunity for a wider group of children from Kings County Tennis League to enjoy the matches at the US Open, Emirates also treated 160 guests, consisting of youth and their guardians, to promenade seats and an invite-only experience at the airline’s hospitality suite. Emirates’ Force for Good initiative, now in its second year, aims to uplift communities and create opportunities for youth of all ages to develop their tennis skills by engaging in educational programs that contribute to their future success and overall wellbeing. The five-year partnership will see Emirates refurbishing tennis court facilities in US cities, with a total commitment of USD 2.5 million.

https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/a-deep-dive-into-decadence-the-journey-of-emirates-caviar-from-source-to-sky/,Emirates' signature caviar service,2025-08-22,"Dubai, UAE, 22 August 2025: From Persia to Poland, Emirates selects and serves some of the world’s most premium Ossetra caviar for its First Class customers. With First Class flyers invited to savour unlimited amounts of the delicacy onboard, Emirates has noted an increase of more than 30% in caviar consumption year on year. The routes recording the highest levels of customers enjoying caviar are Emirates flights between Dubai and London, followed by flights to and from Dubai to Paris and Sydney, and then Moscow and Bangkok. Celebrating the fine nature of the delicacy, Emirates has developed a signature caviar service ritual that is appreciated by First Class customers for its intentional reverence and respect for the gourmet treat. To ensure it is always an impeccable dining experience, Emirates invests significantly into storing and serving caviar correctly – even providing a dedicated chauffeur-drive service to transport caviar to and from aircraft. Caviar is dispatched individually for each flight, and to maintain the cold chain, approximately 165 trips are carried out each day. Caviar is considered a delicacy for many reasons, including its rarity, cost, and the sensory experience it offers—an indulgence that has captivated connoisseurs for centuries. Harvested from the roe of sturgeon, each tiny, glistening bead holds a subtle complexity of taste: delicate yet bold, briny yet buttery, with a texture that melts on the tongue. Onboard Emirates, First Class customers are invited to enjoy unlimited caviar, served as a luxurious, mindful ritual that highlights the rarity of the delicacy. Emirates cabin crew first don pristine white gloves and lay a fresh linen tablecloth on the customer’s table. A curated array of accoutrements are then placed on the cloth for the full caviar experience – crispy melba toast, soft blinis, egg yolk, egg white, chives, white onions, sour cream, and lemon. Emirates cabin crew invite the customer to pair caviar with a glass of Dom Pérignon champagne, which Emirates has exclusive rights to serve in the sky globally. Dom Pérignon’s complex notes of toasted brioche and almond are a sumptuous counterpoint to the salty, nutty, and briny flavours of the caviar, while the acidity and minerality of the champagne cuts through the creamy mouthfeel of caviar to form a perfect pairing. As is tradition with fine caviar, diners are presented with a pure Mother of Pearl spoon so that the delicate taste is not tainted by oxidation from stainless steel utensils. Finally, an exclusive Emirates engraved caviar presentation bowl is placed in front of the customer, and the lid is ceremoniously unveiled to reveal the glimmering aperitif. Emirates serves caviar from the Acipenser baerii fish, commonly known as the Siberian sturgeon. Caviar from Acipenser baerii is medium-sized, ranging in colour from dark grey to brown or black, with a smooth, clean taste and delicate texture. This species of sturgeon is native to the major river systems that flow into the Arctic Ocean, including the Ob, Lena, and Yenisei rivers in Siberia. Siberian sturgeon is selected for caviar production due to its relatively fast growth and adaptability to aquaculture environments, sometimes growing up to 2 meters in length and weighing around 100 kg. This sturgeon matures more quickly than other species, typically producing eggs between 5 to 7 years of age, making it a popular choice for caviar farming. Acipenser baerii plays a vital role in the modern caviar industry, offering a high-quality and more sustainable alternative to wild-sourced roe. As the world’s largest operator of international First Class travel – offering 26,800 seats a week and the largest inventory of international First Class seats in the industry – Emirates’ requirement for caviar is significant. As part of a meticulous production process, the caviar for Emirates is rinsed with water, accentuated with salt, and stored in a chiller before being delivered to Emirates’ supplier. In Dubai, the caviar is then vacuum-packed into ring-pull tins, pasteurised, cooled, and stored in chillers before being delivered to Emirates. The supplier delivers caviar to Emirates Flight Catering Facility (EKFC) in Dubai three times a week in dedicated temperature-controlled vehicles kept below 5°C. When ready for loading, the caviar is transported by its own dedicated Emirates chauffeur in a special vehicle to ensure it remains perfectly chilled. Across Emirates’ many destinations, official caterers also receive caviar from Emirates’ supplier to maintain exceptional standards across all routes.

https://grrrltraveler.com/emirates-airlines-economy-review/,Emirates Airlines Economy Review: The Best Airlines for Long Haul Flights? - GRRRLTRAVELER,2024-09-09,"Being from Hawaii, most of my travels are long haul flights. Getting older and accruing back issues and sciatica, long haul flights can wreak havoc on my body; not to mention, throw my internal clock into wacko! When planning a long-haul flight, choosing the right airline can make a significant difference in my overall travel experience. I heard Emirates Airlines was a premium carrier but I had flown on premium carriers before; some did not live up to their hype. How would Emirates Airlines handle a 16 hour long haul flight? In this Emirates Airlines economy review, I dive into the pros and cons that make flying with Emirates the best economy choice over competitor airlines. I was returning to Kathmandu, a guest of the U.S. Embassy invited to speak about YouTube Monetization at the Creator Mela, the first conference for creators in Nepal. Ordinarily I’d have to book a U.S. airline for the U.S. Embassy to be able to cover it, but this was a very last minute booking with specific dates. Only a couple of U.S. airlines had partners connected to Nepal too. I found a cheap ticket with Korean Airlines (one of my favorite carriers) for $600, but each day I waited, routes were selling out. It was a tricky booking, dealing with 1–2 day time differences, passing through various time zones, layovers, and connecting flights. Airline prices jumped by the day and my options of cheaper carriers dwindled. Over 30 airlines connect to Nepal, but no straight shot from Honolulu; you’re looking at multiple connecting flights. A seat in Emirates Airlines economy became my saving option and the cheapest option. My “cheap” ticket price was $3,400 USD (okay, not quite economy, but considering my circumstances this was the cheapest option). Ordinarily, I’d not pay that type of price. But I needed to be in Kathmandu in a week. As a guest speaker, I was going to be reimbursed for my flight expense. This is the first time my route was not passing through Asia, but through the Middle East.",being from hawaii most of my travels are long haul flights getting older and accruing back issues and

https://mintfares.com/emirates-warns-flyers-new-free-tickets-scam/,Emirates Warns Flyers On New Free Tickets Scam!,2018-04-15,"Emirates is an airline that is based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The airline is a subsidiary of The Emirates Group, which is owned by the government of Dubai’s Investment Corporation of Dubai. Emirates Airlines warns of a free tickets scam, issuing an update for passengers traveling with the airline to be aware of potential fraud. The airline cautions passengers that if they receive a message on Facebook, Twitter, or WhatsApp about Emirates promising free flights, it is likely a scam. A viral message circulated on social media claiming that Emirates had launched a new promotion offering free airfares to celebrate the airline’s anniversary. However, according to the airline, this is a fake tickets scam, and a spokesperson clarified, “We are not giving away tickets.” The airline further stated, “We are aware that there are posts circulating regarding a ticket giveaway for Emirates’ birthday. This is not an official competition and we advise caution. Genuine competitions are only hosted on our official social media accounts, marked with a blue tick.” Emirates also warned against a phishing scam, noting that fraudsters are again sending out fake messages claiming the airline is celebrating its 32nd anniversary and distributing two free air tickets to 500 lucky customers. These fake messages are another example of phishing scams in which criminals trick people into clicking malicious links to steal personal information, passwords, or login credentials.

For anyone who books the luxe cabin using Skywards Miles – whether it’s a full award ticket or an upgrade – it can no longer be used for kids aged eight and under. The policy was implemented as of August 15, 2025, though it does not apply to tickets paid with cash, according to One Mile at a Time. The change is only a limitation on accessing the cabin through miles, making the Dubai-based airline the only known carrier to enforce such a rule. Many people have weighed in on the new policy online, with some questioning why it doesn’t extend to tickets purchased with cash. One person argued, “The only controversial part of this is only applying this to the miles redemptions. Not allowing kids in first class is absolutely logical, and all airlines should have such a policy, but when an airline only does it in instances where it doesn’t hurt their bottom line, it becomes clear that customer experience is not the reason why they do it.” Some first-class flyers agreed with the restriction, saying, “I do not want to have my first class experience ruined by the noise of a small child. I paid money for a quiet, lovely experience.” The terms and conditions of the Skywards program were updated to state: “Please note that passengers aged 8 years old and below are ineligible for First Class Emirates Classic Rewards and Upgrade Rewards,” according to One Mile at a Time. The change has sparked heated discussions on whether children should even be allowed in first class, with some describing the policy as “sad.” One woman wrote, “Honestly, I believe that kids should not be allowed in first class. The last couple times I flew internationally, we had infants in first class that cried the whole time. I don’t want to hear your kid screaming. I am paying for a relaxing, comfortable flight and your infant ruins that for everyone.” Her comment was met with strong backlash, with another user responding, “Maybe it’s time you get your own private jet before complaining about sharing PUBLIC transport with the PUBLIC. Believe it or not, children count. I’m pretty sure the parent of the screaming child found that flight far harder than you did, where you can simply ignore, pop in some headphones, or use earplugs.” Another parent fired back, “Some of you might want to stop your celebratory dance. Those of us who can afford to fly our kids in business class aren’t just using miles to book our tickets. My toddler will see you on your next flight.” One mother added that she wished there were “family-only” flights, saying, “People can be so awful toward families as you can see in this comment section. The last thing I want is for my child to be crying or bothering anyone on a plane. It’s actually incredibly stressful for us, too.

https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/emirates-no-young-kids-first-class-using-miles/,Emirates restricts first-class award bookings for young children - The Points Guy,2025-09-04,"If you're a parent with young children who's been eyeing a first-class award redemption for your family using Emirates Skywards miles, it's time to rethink your plans. Emirates has quietly added a new family-unfriendly policy banning children ages 8 and younger from booking first-class seats with Emirates Skywards miles or using miles to upgrade from business class to first class, as first reported by One Mile at a Time. With this change, Emirates further tightens access to its first-class award redemptions. In May, Emirates began limiting Skywards bookings of first-class award seats to members with elite status. Earning Skywards miles via credit card programs has also been getting more difficult, as Chase is dropping Emirates as a transfer partner next month, Citi recently reduced the transfer ratio for Emirates, and American Express will reduce its transfer ratio soon, too. As of now, the policy only applies to award redemptions, not paid fare bookings. It's also unclear whether the no-young-children policy applies to partner bookings via Air Canada Aeroplan or Qantas Frequent Flyer, where you can still book Emirates first class without status. Keep in mind that Aeroplan has dynamic pricing for Emirates redemptions, and Qantas increased its award rates on August 5. Emirates continues to limit access to first-class award redemptions, first by adding a requirement for elite status and now by restricting children ages 8 and under from booking or upgrading with Skywards miles. While it’s true that young children can sometimes be disruptive to other travelers and passengers who book first class expect a quieter and more comfortable experience, it doesn’t make much sense to only ban kids from award redemptions. Do the children from families who pay the full cash fare behave better? Many would argue that children will be children, regardless of how their flight was booked. It’s already often hard for families to find multiple award seats, and this new restriction adds another hurdle for families who want to travel comfortably and in luxury. The terms and conditions of the Skywards program have been updated to read: “Please note that passengers aged 8 years old and below are ineligible for First Class Emirates Classic Rewards and Upgrade Rewards.” This change was added in mid-August, according to One Mile at a Time.",if you re a parent with young children who s been eyeing a first class award redemption for your family using emirates

https://www.the-independent.com/travel/news-and-advice/emirates-skywards-kids-first-class-policy-b2829003.html,Emirates policy change sparks debate over kids in first-class cabins | The Independent,2025-09-18,"A new Emirates policy banning kids eight years and under from collecting rewards has sparked a debate over whether younger passengers should be allowed in first-class cabins. Middle East airline Emirates has updated its rules for its Skywards Programme, a loyalty scheme that allows passengers to earn miles when flying and spend them on upgrades, future flights, and other rewards. However, a new change will impact families flying with the airline, as kids aged eight and under will no longer be allowed to use miles to book first-class seats. “Please note that passengers aged eight years old and below are ineligible for first class Emirates classic rewards and upgrade rewards,” Emirates Skywards rules state. This policy, first reported by One Mile At A Time, was added by Emirates in August. While young passengers can no longer use miles to purchase or upgrade to first-class seats, there is no mention in Emirates’ policies that children under nine cannot be bought a first-class ticket using cash. Although kids have not been completely banned from the first-class cabin, the inability to earn and use miles for upgrades has caused a stir among families traveling with children. Emirates also clarified that “Emirates classic rewards are not available to blue tier members or passengers aged eight years old and below in first class, and only members (aged nine-plus) whose membership tier is silver, gold, or platinum at the time of booking are permitted to redeem first class Emirates classic rewards.” American travel website The Points Guy posted the news on Instagram, calling the policy “family unfriendly.” The comments section quickly turned into a heated debate over whether kids belong in first class. Canadian model Khloë Terae weighed in, stating, “You are entitled to a child-free life but not a child-free world.

https://www.travelpulse.com/news/airlines-airports/emirates-just-made-it-harder-to-fly-in-first-class-with-kids,This Airline Just Made It Harder to Fly First Class With Kids,2025-09-11,"One of the world’s most luxurious airlines is changing its rules for booking first-class tickets with children. Dubai-based carrier Emirates recently updated its terms and conditions with new restrictions on redeeming frequent flier miles for first-class tickets with young children. “Please note that passengers aged 8 years old and below are ineligible for First Class Emirates Classic Rewards and Upgrade Rewards,” says the airline’s new policy, which went into effect on August 15 and was first reported by aviation blog One Mile at a Time. Whether children should fly in first class is one of the most hotly debated etiquette topics in air travel. Proponents of banning kids in premium cabins argue that children detract from the luxury experience because they can be noisy, while many family travelers say they should be allowed to travel in whatever cabin they’d like. “The thought of those people who desperately try to scrape together miles to be able to do something like this as a family, and now won’t be able to, makes me sad,” said Australian travel journalist Kristine Tarbert in an online op-ed about the new policy. In recent months, Emirates has been making subtle changes to its first class to make it even more exclusive, including tightening restrictions on who can book into the legendary cabin. In May, the carrier limited Skywards Miles redemptions for first-class tickets to only fliers with elite status. The airline will also no longer be a transfer partner for Chase credit card points starting in October 2025, making it harder for some travelers to earn enough miles to redeem a first-class ticket. Emirates’ first class is famous for its opulent amenities, such as fully enclosed suites with lie-flat beds and personal minibars, upscale dining, impeccable service, and even a shower suite on its Airbus A380 planes. This year, Emirates has introduced even more lavish touches to its first-class cabin, including the debut of white-glove meal service and the addition of a coveted vintage of Dom Perignon Rosé Champagne to its wine list. With all of these changes, Emirates’ first class doesn’t seem likely to lose the exclusive mystique it holds with travelers anytime soon. The change means that children aged 8 and under are no longer allowed to fly with their parents in the lavish cabin when using Emirates Skywards Miles or when families want to use miles to upgrade to first class. However, children of all ages are still allowed to fly first class on fares booked with cash.",one of the world’s most luxurious airlines is changing its rules for booking first class tickets with

https://thriftytraveler.com/news/airlines/emirates-bans-kids-in-first-class/,No Caviar for You: Emirates Bans (Some) Kids From Flying First Class,2025-09-04,"Love it or hate it, Emirates just made a major change that could affect traveling families – “bougie” traveling families, that is. As first noted by One Mile at a Time, the Dubai-based airline quietly added terms and conditions in mid-August banning children aged eight and younger from flying first class when redeeming Skywards miles or using miles to upgrade. The update appears in the Skywards program rules and had gone largely unnoticed until now. In a section covering “Skywards Skysurfers” – Emirates’ name for minor Skywards members – the policy is even clearer: “Please note that passengers aged 8 years old and below are ineligible for First Class Emirates Classic Rewards and Upgrade Rewards.” The broader concern is precedent. With Emirates implementing this new rule, will other airlines soon follow? It's impossible to say, but this is just Emirates' latest step in limiting access to first class awards. In May, the airline began requiring at least Silver status to book first class awards, blocking everyday Skywards members. More recently, Chase announced it was dropping Emirates as a transfer partner, while Citi – and soon American Express – reduced transfer ratios. It certainly looks like Emirates is trying its best to keep the “riffraff” out of first class. To be clear, this ban applies only to award tickets and mileage upgrades. If you’re paying cash for a first class seat, Emirates will still allow young children up front. Families with means are apparently less disruptive! As of publication, it’s unclear how this rule affects first class awards booked through partners such as Air Canada Aeroplan or Qantas Frequent Flyer. You can still technically book first class awards for children eight and under on Emirates’ website, but it remains to be seen whether those seats will be honored at the gate. So what should we make of this? Whether kids belong in premium cabins has long been a divisive topic. Travelers spending thousands for a quiet, restful flight – often on business – understandably want a relaxing experience. On the other hand, this move feels punitive because it doesn’t ban kids outright, only those using miles. As a family traveler myself, I hate to see rules that make trips harder or less enjoyable for families. Practically speaking, though, with first class awards to Dubai often running close to 200,000 Skywards miles plus nearly $1,000 in taxes and fees, most families weren’t booking these seats

https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-creates-us-200-million-aviation-sustainability-fund/,Emirates creates US$ 200 million aviation sustainability fund,2023-05-11,"Dubai, UAE, 11 May 2023 – Emirates, the world’s largest international airline, today announced it has committed US$200 million to fund research and development (R&D) projects focused on reducing the impact of fossil fuels in commercial aviation. This is the biggest single commitment by any airline toward sustainability, with funds to be disbursed over three years. Emirates will identify partnerships with leading organizations working on solutions in advanced fuel and energy technologies. Sir Tim Clark, President Emirates Airline, said, “We are ring-fencing US$200 million to invest in advanced fuel and energy solutions for aviation, which is where airlines currently face the biggest impediment in reducing our environmental impact. We looked long and hard at the reality we face in commercial aircraft and engine technology, fuel supply chain, and our industry’s regulatory and ecosystem requirements. It’s clear that with the current pathways available to airlines in terms of emissions reduction, our industry won’t be able to hit net zero targets in the prescribed timeline. We believe our industry needs better solutions, and that’s why we’re looking to partner with leading organizations on R&D. Our aim is to contribute meaningfully to practical solutions for the long-term sustainability of commercial aviation.” Sir Tim added, “Until viable solutions can be found, Emirates will continue to implement environmentally responsible practices throughout our business, including uplifting SAF where feasible, ensuring efficient fleet operations, and inducting modern aircraft into our fleet. Our US$200 million fund is earmarked for R&D, and not for operating costs like the purchase of SAF or carbon offsets to tick regulatory boxes—activities we consider business-as-usual.” Emirates’ Environmental Sustainability Executive Steering Group will oversee disbursements from the fund, with support from technical experts. Emirates’ long-standing environmental policy and strategy focus on three areas: emissions reduction, responsible consumption, and the conservation of wildlife and habitats. In January, Emirates successfully completed the first 100% SAF-powered demonstration flight in partnership with Boeing and GE. Since its first flight powered by SAF in 2017, the airline continues to participate actively in the SAF market and seeks opportunities in its network to use SAF where feasible. However, bio-based SAF, currently the only type of commercially available SAF, is extremely limited in supply. IATA estimates that the entire world’s annual supply of SAF meets less than 0.1% of airlines’ needs. Emirates participates in a range of industry working groups and stakeholder engagements on sustainable aviation fuel. In recent months, together with the UAE GCAA, the airline contributed to the development of the UAE’s power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels roadmap, launched in July 2022, and the UAE’s National Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap launched in January 2023. Emirates’ investment in flying a young and modern aircraft fleet remains its biggest commitment to reducing emissions. The airline currently has 200 of the latest Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft on order, including A350s and 777Xs. The airline also has a comprehensive fuel efficiency program that actively investigates and implements ways to reduce unnecessary fuel burn and emissions wherever operationally feasible. Some of the program’s most significant initiatives include operating “flex tracks” or flexible routings that take advantage of natural tailwinds while avoiding headwinds and weather systems—an effort ongoing since 2003—and introducing fuel-efficient practices on the ground, such as using ground power units instead of the aircraft Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and switching one or two engines off while taxiing after landing. Emirates also invests in renewable energy initiatives, including the installation of solar panels to power some of its operational buildings in Dubai and the use of electric vehicles both airside and landside.",dubai uae 11 may 2023 – emirates the world’s largest international airline today announced it has committed us 200 million to fund research and development r d projects focused on reducing

https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/new-uae-corporate-tax-barely-ruffles-emirates-full-year-financial-performance/162907.article,New UAE corporate tax barely ruffles Emirates full-year financial performance,2025-05-08,"Emirates Group has paid its first corporate tax under the United Arab Emirates’ new business law, though the legislation had minimal impact on its full-year financial performance. The UAE Ministry of Finance introduced a 9% corporate tax in January 2022, applicable to companies whose financial year began on or after June 1, 2023. The government stated that the tax aims to accelerate economic development, align with international tax transparency standards, and prevent harmful tax practices. Emirates Group’s first financial year under the new regulation began on April 1, 2024. The company said it conducted a large-scale internal programme to establish governance and compliance systems to ensure readiness for the new tax. In its financial results for the year ending March 31, the group reported a pre-tax profit of Dhs22.75 billion ($6.19 billion) and a post-tax profit of Dhs20.46 billion after accounting for the new UAE corporate tax. Emirates Airline, the flagship carrier, posted a pre-tax profit of Dhs21.2 billion, marking a 20% year-on-year increase. “The airline has delivered this exceptional performance while navigating a new financial terrain,” the company said, adding that despite the 9% corporate tax, it not only maintained profitability but increased it significantly. Emirates’ revenue reached a record Dhs127.9 billion, up 6%, while group revenue also rose 6% to Dhs145.4 billion. The group achieved its highest-ever EBITDA of Dhs42.2 billion, reflecting strong operating profitability. Ground-handling arm Dnata surpassed Dhs20 billion in revenue for the first time, but its net profit declined 2% to just under Dhs1.4 billion due to the new tax and one-time impairments in the UK and Germany. Group chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said Emirates and Dnata “moved quickly to meet strong demand for air transport services across markets and win over customers,” adding that the group has “raised the bar to set new records for profit, revenue, and cash assets.”",emirates group has paid its first corporate tax under the united arab emirates’ new business law though the legislation

In a statement, Emirates said it had also signed a multi-year lease extension with Dubai Aerospace Enterprise for four Boeing 777Fs already in operation.

The order for additional current-generation 777F aircraft surfaced amid ongoing tensions between Emirates and Boeing over delays in other programmes but was placed before Boeing announced that its 777X jetliner series would be delayed again until 2026. In September, Boeing reported orders for 11 777F freighters from undisclosed customers, and sources said part of that total included a new order from Emirates. Both the airline and Boeing declined to comment. Emirates is the largest operator of Boeing’s 777 family and the biggest customer for its delayed 777X successor. Earlier in the week, Emirates Airline President Tim Clark criticised Boeing for the cumulative six-year delay to the 777X as the manufacturer continues to face industrial and financial challenges. Emirates currently operates about a dozen 777F freighters, with four more on order under its name, according to Cirium Ascend and Boeing data. The airline is also leasing four Boeing 747s with crews to meet strong cargo demand. Airlines often choose to keep new aircraft orders undisclosed until formal announcements are made. Abu Dhabi-based newspaper *The National* quoted a senior Emirates executive saying the carrier planned to announce a further investment in freighters in the coming weeks. The executive added that Emirates was in discussions for freighter variants of the newer Airbus A350 and future Boeing 777X models as part of a plan to triple its cargo fleet by 2030. None of the involved parties agreed to comment. Analysts noted that the continued delays in passenger aircraft production and the growing need for dedicated freighters are closely linked. Rob Morris, head of global consultancy at Cirium Ascend, said demand for freighter aircraft is being sustained by a shortage of passenger planes from Boeing and Airbus, as a large share of global air

https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/emirates-tells-rolls-royce-go-back-basics-get-engines-right-2023-11-29/,"Exclusive: Emirates tells Rolls-Royce: Go back to basics, put products first",2023-11-29,"PARIS, Nov 29 (Reuters) - The head of Dubai's Emirates has urged Rolls-Royce to go “back to basics” and focus on improving the performance of its engines, a day after the British company announced plans to quadruple profits. Shares in Rolls-Royce rose after CEO Tufan Erginbilgic unveiled a turnaround strategy aimed at boosting profit margins and introducing “value-driven pricing,” which implies higher servicing costs for airlines. However, Emirates Airline President Tim Clark, who recently criticised Rolls-Royce over engine performance and pricing at the Dubai Airshow, was not convinced by the plan, which depends on raising civil engine profit margins to 15–17%. Clark said, “If you have an engine not performing as it should do, your costs are going to rise. But your ability to extract value from the client is going to fall simply because the client won’t accept non-performance.” At the Dubai Airshow, Clark ruled out buying Airbus A350-1000 jets, citing issues with the durability of Rolls-Royce’s XWB-97 engines and the company’s push for higher service fees. “I said, guys, you need to go back to basics. Design engines that meet what the client base wants,” Clark said, explaining that the dispute led Emirates to instead order more of the smaller A350-900. He added that the situation “opened the door” to reconsidering Boeing’s 777-8 model as both a passenger and freighter option. Rolls-Royce acknowledged that downtime on the XWB-97 is higher than expected but denied the engines are “defective.” Clark noted that ordering the A350-1000 was still possible if Rolls-Royce could resolve the issue, with upgrades from Ultrafan technology expected in 2025 or 2026. “Get your engines right,” he said. “You come up with a good engine, and we will talk to you seriously about maintenance costs that give you the returns you seek without being over-greedy.” Erginbilgic said the durability problem was limited to the XWB-97 used on the A350-1000 and mainly in hot climates, adding that Rolls-Royce was working with Airbus to enhance the engine. The dispute reflects a broader industry tension between fuel efficiency and durability—engineers must balance fuel savings and reduced emissions against longer maintenance intervals, particularly in harsh environments. Engine manufacturers argue they deserve higher returns for their investments in efficiency, while airlines counter that they suffer most when technical failures disrupt operations. “When I see people talking about rates of return of 10% or 15%, and we’re struggling in the realm of 3% or 4% as an industry—it’s a partnership,” Clark said, rejecting the idea of higher hourly maintenance pricing. He praised Rolls-Royce as the “gold standard” in engineering but said manufacturers had been “coming at it the wrong way.” Clark also criticised Boeing over its quality and production issues, echoing industry-wide frustration with supply chain and manufacturing problems since the pandemic. His message to the industry was clear: “You’re all fixated on buybacks and rates of return. Build us the airplanes that we want, and all this will fall into place.”",paris nov 29 reuters the head of dubai s emirates has urged rolls royce to go “back to basics” and focus on improving the

durability problem was limited to the xwb 97 used on the a350 1000 and mainly in hot climates adding that rolls royce was working with airbus to enhance the engine the dispute reflects a broader industry tension between fuel efficiency and durability—engineers must balance fuel savings and reduced emissions against longer maintenance intervals particularly in harsh environments engine manufacturers argue they deserve higher returns for their investments in efficiency while airlines counter that they suffer most when technical failures disrupt operations “ when i see people talking

rolls royce as the “ gold standard ” in engineering but said manufacturers had been “ coming at it the wrong way ” clark also criticised boeing over its quality and production issues echoing industry

https://www.emirates.com/media-centre/emirates-group-announces-2023-24-results/,Emirates Group announces 2023-24 results,2024-05-12,"The Emirates Group reported its best-ever financial performance for 2023–24, achieving a record profit of AED 18.7 billion (US$ 5.1 billion), up 71% from the previous year, alongside record revenue and cash assets. Group revenue rose 15% to AED 137.3 billion (US$ 37.4 billion), driven by strong global customer demand across all business segments. The Group ended the year with its highest-ever cash balance of AED 47.1 billion (US$ 12.8 billion) and declared a dividend of AED 4 billion (US$ 1.1 billion) to its owner, the Investment Corporation of Dubai. Chairman and Chief Executive Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum credited the success to Dubai’s progressive policies and said the strong financial position enables continued investment in new aircraft, facilities, technology, and people. Emirates airline recorded a new profit high of AED 17.2 billion (US$ 4.7 billion), up 63% from AED 10.6 billion last year, with revenue rising 13% to AED 121.2 billion (US$ 33.0 billion). The airline increased capacity by 20% to 57.7 billion available tonne kilometres (ATKMs), nearly reaching pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, dnata achieved a record profit of AED 1.4 billion (US$ 0.4 billion), a sharp rise from AED 331 million last year. dnata’s revenue grew 29% to AED 19.2 billion (US$ 5.2 billion), reflecting higher flight activity, expanded customer portfolios, new global lounge facilities, and investment in advanced equipment and technology. In total, the Group invested AED 8.8 billion (US$ 2.4 billion) during the year in aircraft, facilities, equipment, and new technologies. Its workforce grew 10% to an all-time high of 112,406 employees as Emirates and dnata ramped up global recruitment to support expansion. Sustainability remained a key focus area, with Emirates introducing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for the first time at its Dubai hub and in Amsterdam and Singapore. The airline also operated a pioneering A380 demonstration flight using 100% SAF in one engine and established a US$ 200 million fund for R&D to reduce fossil fuel dependence in aviation. Emirates became a founding member of Air-CRAFT, a UAE-based renewable aviation fuel consortium, and joined The Solent Cluster in the UK for low-carbon fuel production. dnata expanded its electric and hybrid ground vehicle fleet, transitioned its UAE logistics and tourism units to biofuel, and earned the IATA Environmental Management (IEnvA) certification for sustainability leadership. The Group also strengthened its focus on workforce development, launching new learning programs with top universities and partners, and forming a Gender Balance Council to promote equality. It expanded its ESG reporting framework in alignment with GRI standards and plans to adopt ISSB and CSRD standards in upcoming years. Sheikh Ahmed said the Group enters the 2024–25 financial year on a strong foundation. Emirates will receive 10 new Airbus A350 aircraft, while dnata will expand operations by leveraging scale and technology. He noted the Group’s commitment to environmental sustainability, customer satisfaction, and community welfare remains central to its growth strategy. Looking ahead, Dubai’s government has launched the next phase of expansion at Al Maktoum International Airport—a AED 128 billion (US$ 35 billion) investment that will become the new hub for Emirates and dnata, significantly boosting Dubai’s global aviation and logistics capacity.",the emirates group reported its best ever financial performance for 2023–24 achieving a record profit of aed 18 7

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/04/29/atm-2025-emirates-expects-record-annual-results-and-is-ipo-ready-sheikh-ahmed-says/,"ATM 2025: Emirates expects record annual results and is IPO-ready, Sheikh Ahmed says  | The National",2025-04-29,"Emirates expects a “record” annual financial result, said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group, adding that if the Dubai government asked the company to list, he would proceed with it. “We are very satisfied when it comes to our cash reserves on the airline side,” he said at a press conference on Monday during the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai. “If they [the Dubai government] say do it [an initial public offering] tomorrow, I have to do it.” The airline, which is retrofitting about 90 per cent of its fleet and has more than 300 aircraft on order, has an appetite for new jets and hinted at a possible plane order at the Dubai Airshow in November. “We’re also thinking about the Dubai Airshow and maybe there will be some new announcement,” Sheikh Ahmed said, declining to specify the size or type of aircraft. Emirates president Tim Clark told Bloomberg TV in March that the carrier is “in the market” for more Airbus A350s and Boeing 777Xs. When asked if the larger A350-1000 was being considered despite engine performance concerns, Sheikh Ahmed said: “We look at it, but no decision has been made.” He said Emirates expects to receive the long-delayed Boeing 777X in the second half of 2026 and 12 to 15 Airbus A350-900s this year. The airline will spend about $5 billion to retrofit its older Boeing 777s and discontinued Airbus A380s to extend their lifespan amid aircraft delivery delays. While Emirates receives compensation for delays, Sheikh Ahmed said it cannot match the revenue from flying new planes. “Compensation is not to the extent that I want to see the aircraft flying. I will be able to make more money than the compensation,” he said, adding that Emirates should have received 90 Boeing 777Xs by now if deliveries were on schedule. Asked if Emirates would consider purchasing Boeing aircraft originally destined for Chinese airlines amid the US-China trade tensions, Sheikh Ahmed said: “Maybe yes, but also it’s not as simple as that.” He explained that such aircraft would require major interior modifications to meet Emirates’ standards, which would increase costs significantly. “I’m sure Boeing will not sell it at half the price. Taking this aircraft, stripping this aircraft, retrofitting, it will be a bit expensive,” he said. Regarding US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Sheikh Ahmed said there had been no impact on Emirates’ business. “It’s a bit early for me to pre-judge as we speak today, but I always remain very optimistic. We are doing very well in terms of traffic and seat factor across the network. I didn’t see any shift in terms of decline in the number of people traveling to the US,” he said, adding that 2025 would be another strong year for the airline. Sheikh Ahmed also confirmed that Dubai has awarded contracts for the $35 billion new terminal at Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), marking major progress in the project. Work has begun since Dubai’s ruler approved the plan a year ago, and Emirates is expected to relocate its operations to DWC within the decade. “When we talk about an airport of that size, we have to think how complex it can be,” he said. Stakeholders including Emirates, Flydubai, Dubai Airports, and Dnata are preparing detailed plans to ensure a smooth transition. Sheikh Ahmed said an extensive Operational Readiness and Airport Transfer (ORAT) programme will be required, with at least 12 months of training and preparation before opening day.",emirates expects a

The airline recorded Dh19.06 billion ($5.2 billion) in post-tax profits for the financial year ended March 31. Revenue rose by 6 per cent to Dh127.9 billion ($34.9 billion) as it carried more passengers through its Dubai hub. Growth was driven by sustained appetite for travel across markets, an upsurge in air cargo demand and lower fuel costs, the airline said in its annual report. The wider Emirates Group, which includes global airport services company dnata, recorded post-tax profit of Dh20.4 billion, up 9.7 per cent annually, while revenue rose 6 per cent to Dh145.4 billion. This performance places the Emirates Group as the most profitable aviation group globally in the 2024–25 reporting period. “It is no accident that Dubai has produced hugely successful global aviation entities including Emirates and dnata,” said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group. “Dubai’s aviation sector has become an influential force on the global stage. We don’t cut corners, and we don’t take shortcuts that put our future at risk for short-term gains.” Emirates carried more than 53.6 million passengers during the fiscal year, up 3.4 per cent from a year ago. Capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, increased by 3.9 per cent, while load factor reached 78.9 per cent, slightly down from 79.9 per cent the previous year. Emirates also expanded its network, adding Bogota and Madagascar, and restarting flights to Phnom Penh, Lagos, Adelaide, and Edinburgh, serving 148 cities in 80 countries as of the end of March. The airline benefitted from major passenger flows through Dubai despite regional tensions and economic uncertainty linked to US President Donald Trump’s trade policies. Analysts noted that Emirates’ strong results reflect brand strength and the success of investments in its A380, 777, and new A350-900 fleets. While concerns remain about potential US tariffs, analysts believe the UAE and US will likely reach agreements to limit any impact before the arrival of the new 777X jets in 2026. Dubai’s tourism also continued to grow, with international visitor numbers rising 3 per cent to 5.31 million in the first quarter of 2025 and a total of 18.7 million visitors in 2024, up 9 per cent annually. Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, handled 23.4 million passengers in the first three months of 2025, up 1.5 per cent year-on-year, while the city moves forward with a $35 billion expansion at Al Maktoum International Airport, the future home of Emirates. Emirates, which operates a fleet of Boeing 777, Airbus A380, and A350 aircraft, has more than 300 aircraft on order, primarily 777X wide-bodies. It expects to receive the first 777X jets in late 2026 and between 12 and 15 A350s by the end of 2025. Due to delays in new aircraft deliveries, Emirates expanded its retrofit programme to include 219 aircraft at a total investment of $5 billion. The airline also raised Dh3.2 billion in aircraft financing this year through a mix of commercial loans, export credit facilities, and Japanese operating leases, ensuring strong liquidity to support

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2024/11/07/emirates-group-posts-record-half-year-profit/,Emirates posts $2.4 billion first-half profit in UAE's first corporate tax year | The National,2024-11-07,"Emirates, the world's biggest long-haul airline, posted a first-half profit after tax of Dh8.7 billion ($2.4 billion) in the first financial year that the UAE corporate income tax is applied to the company. This figure is 7 per cent below the Dh9.4 billion post-tax profit the airline recorded during the first six months of its financial year from April to September. The figures for September 2024 and September 2023 are not directly comparable, given that it is the first fiscal year the 9 per cent corporate tax applies to Emirates' financial reporting, the airline said. Emirates’ profit before tax reached a record Dh9.7 billion in the April to September period, compared to Dh9.5 billion a year ago, reflecting strong travel and air cargo demand across its markets. Revenue rose five per cent year-on-year to a record Dh62.2 billion. “We expect customer demand to remain strong for the rest of 2024-25, and we look forward to increasing our capacity to grow revenues as new aircraft join the Emirates fleet and new facilities come online at dnata,” said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group. “The outlook is positive, but we don’t intend to rest on our laurels. We will stay agile in deploying our capacity and resources in a dynamic marketplace.” Emirates recorded solid travel demand in the first six months of its fiscal year despite the Israel-Gaza war. Flights to Israel, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Iran have been affected by the conflict, but the airline still increased flights to eight cities—Amsterdam, Cebu, Clark, Luanda, Lyon, Madrid, Manila, and Singapore—and launched new routes to Bogota via Miami in June and Madagascar via Seychelles in September. Dubai International Airport, Emirates' home base, handled a record 44.9 million passengers in the first half of 2024, up 8 per cent year-on-year. Emirates carried 26.9 million passengers between April and September, up 3 per cent from last year, while capacity (Available Seat Kilometres) rose 4 per cent. Load factor dipped slightly to 80 per cent from 81.5 per cent. Operating costs, including fuel, increased by 6 per cent in line with expanded operations, with fuel remaining the largest cost component at 32 per cent, down slightly from 34 per cent last year. Emirates SkyCargo carried nearly 1.2 million tonnes in the first six months, up 16 per cent, driven by strong Chinese e-commerce volumes and increased shipments to Dubai. The Emirates Group, including Dnata, reported a post-tax profit of Dh9.3 billion after accounting for the 9 per cent tax charge, with pre-tax profit up 1 per cent to Dh10.4 billion. Group revenue rose five per cent to Dh70.8 billion, reflecting consistently strong demand across all regions. “This again illustrates the power of our proven business model working in combination with Dubai's growth trajectory as a city of choice to live, work, visit, connect through and do business in,” Sheikh Ahmed said. The group ended the half-year with Dh43.7 billion in cash, down from Dh47.1 billion in March, after using reserves to fund new aircraft orders and debt payments. It also paid Dh2 billion in dividends to its Dubai government owner. The workforce grew 3 per cent year-on-year to 114,610 as of September 30. Dnata, the group’s airport services arm, recorded a 19 per cent decline in post-tax profit to Dh571 million and a 5 per cent drop in pre-tax profit to Dh720 million due to a one-off impairment charge of Dh152 million.",emirates the world s biggest long haul airline posted a first half profit after tax of dh8 7 billion 2 4 billion in the first financial year that the uae corporate income tax is

https://www.thenationalnews.com/travel/2025/07/01/emirates-shenzhen-china-flights/,Emirates launches inaugural flight to China’s tech hub Shenzhen | The National,2025-07-01,"Emirates launched its inaugural flight to Shenzhen on Tuesday, marking the Dubai airline's entry into China’s fourth-largest city. A senior delegation from Emirates, including Orhan Abbas, senior vice president for commercial operations in the Far East, was on board. Departing Dubai International’s Terminal 3 at 3.35am local time, flight EK328 arrived in Shenzhen’s Bao’an International Airport at 3.30pm, completing a seven-hour and 55-minute journey across the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, mainland South-East Asia and southern China. From Wednesday, the route will operate daily, departing Dubai at 10.05am and arriving in Shenzhen at 10pm. The return flight leaves Shenzhen at 11.55pm and lands in Dubai at 3.40am the following day. According to the airline, the schedule supports connections through Dubai to destinations across Africa, Europe and the Americas. Shenzhen is Emirates’s fourth destination in mainland China, joining Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. It is also the first Chinese destination to be served by the airline’s retrofitted Boeing 777-300ER, which has a capacity of 332 passengers and offers private suites in first class, lie-flat seats in business, as well as premium economy and economy cabins. For Shadi Al Refai, one of the passengers on the inaugural flight and founder of Dubai’s Garage Studios, the direct link to Shenzhen is a major timesaver. He previously had to fly into Hong Kong and then catch a train or boat to Shenzhen, which added three to four hours to his travel time. “Now it’s more streamlined, and that’s great because it allows me to focus on what I need to do,” he said. “Instead of spending that extra time travelling, I can use it to explore the city, which I’ve found to be really friendly and full of things to see.” The Emirates arrival adds to the busy operations at Bao’an International Airport, which handled more than 61.5 million travellers in 2024, according to the Centre for Aviation. The airport currently has two runways, with a third nearing completion and expected to open later this year. Terminal 3 has been expanded to accommodate international flights to destinations such as Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. Bao’an International Airport also serves as a key gateway to China’s Greater Bay Area, which includes Hong Kong and Macau. The new route adds to Emirates’s passenger and cargo operations from China, with the airline stating its weekly cargo capacity from the mainland now totals 2,000 tonnes. Positioned as a growing technology hub – home to Huaqiangbei, one of the largest electronics markets in the world – and located within China’s Special Economic Zone, Shenzhen is expected to generate new cargo demand, particularly for the specialised handling and export of electronics and tech products. “Our expansion into Shenzhen opens new doors for business and economic exchange between this technological powerhouse and global markets,” said Adnan Kazim, Emirates's deputy president and chief commercial officer. “As we prepare to launch operations, we extend our gratitude to the Chinese authorities and airport partners for their ongoing support, and we are committed to ensuring this route’s success while fostering cultural bonds and unlocking future economic potential.”",emirates

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/04/24/emirates-bookings-trump-tariffs/,Emirates airline records 'solid' US travel bookings despite Trump tariffs | The National,2025-04-24,"Emirates airline recorded “solid” travel bookings between Dubai and the US in April as demand for flights remains unaffected by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, said the company's chief commercial officer. Adnan Kazim said it was too early to see an impact but so far, “we haven't seen a dip coming in”. “From the evidence that we have from the numbers, the way it's shaping up for us, we're not seeing an impact,” he said on Thursday before the Arabian Travel Market (ATM) next week. “Still, the growth pattern is looking quite positive.” The airline is used to coping with disruptions such as geopolitical instability, economic recessions, currency fluctuations and high fuel prices, so its annual financial results announcement in May will indicate that “you can always manoeuvre through these sort of uncertainties”, Mr Kazim said. “It is part of the DNA now of the business,” he said. “We've gone through many of these kind of turbulences in the past and we've come out of it even stronger.” Mr Trump's tariffs regime is spiralling into a trade war and poses the biggest uncertainty for the aviation industry since the pandemic. With little clarity on how travellers will behave in the face of a potentially deteriorating global economy and its impact on discretionary spending, airlines are struggling to accurately forecast their business. Issam Kazim, chief executive of Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, said the emirate was in a good position to weather economic shocks due to its tourism track record and geographic position. “I am confident that … Dubai is very well positioned to ride this wave. The diversified approach that we've created for the destination helps us in this,” he said. He acknowledged that some markets will be affected more than others, but that travel remained crucial for doing business. Travel patterns may also shift with people taking either short breaks or fewer holidays with longer stays, he added. “There will be that segment that we need to focus on within travelling parties and I am confident that we will be able to ride this wave in a positive way,” he said. Dubai recorded a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in international visitors during the first quarter of 2025, according to the emirate's tourism chief. “There are a lot of changes that are happening globally but with the diversified marketing approach that we have designed for ourselves, it gives us a chance to shift our focus as and when needed to make sure that the overall growth continues to be seen,” he added. The Middle East travel and tourism centre is seeking to grow the number of tourists, length of stay, spending, contribution to GDP and repeat visits. “The length of stay has changed quite a bit: People are starting to see Dubai not just as a transit destination any more … but a destination where they want to spend a longer period of time. That works greatly for us,” he said. Emirates' forward bookings across its network of 150 destinations for May and into the summer are “really positive”, the airline executive said. “The outlook is trending even better than last year in terms of overall booking.” This indicates that economic uncertainties and currency fluctuations are unlikely to dampen a post-Covid surge in travel demand, with people continuing to spend money on travelling, he added. Asked if the US-China trade war may have an impact on the airline's business after expanding into Asia's biggest economy, Mr Kazim said that Dubai could benefit in terms of companies moving their operations to the emirate. Emirates also plans to launch more routes to China in the “near future” after recently announcing daily non-stop flights between Dubai and Shenzhen from July 1, he said. Emirates has so far received four Airbus A350s and expects to take delivery of another 12 to 15 of the wide-body model by the end of summer, the airline executive said. “With a capacity of 312 seats, it gives you flexibility in deployment, it can enter into many regional secondary markets which is what we're doing today,” he said. In March, Emirates said its summer schedule will include A350 services to Tunis, Amman, Istanbul, Dammam, Ho Chi Minh City, Baghdad and Oslo. A second tranche of A350s will arrive after the summer that will be used on ultra-long-haul routes, with destinations to be announced soon, he said. Emirates has already retrofitted 51 of its Boeing and Airbus wide-body planes, with plans to increase that to 87 jets by the end of 2025, according to Mr Kazim. The retrofitted aircraft currently fly to 36 destinations, which will increase to 73 by the end of the calendar year. As Emirates overhauls its aircraft interiors, it plans to increase the number of premium seats in its planes. The airline will add one million premium economy seats, to the one million it currently has, by the end of 2025, he said. This comes amid higher passenger demand from corporate travellers as companies are spending less on travel budgets after the pandemic, according to Emirates' Mr Kazim. “We’re seeing more passengers moving from economy to premium economy, rather than cannibalising the business class,” he said.",emirates airline recorded “solid” travel bookings between dubai and the us in april as demand for

Dubai, UAE: 21 November 2023 – Emirates takes centre stage at the ULTRAs 2023 Awards, taking home two coveted accolades. Crowned “Best Airline in the World” and “Best Airline in the Middle East,” the world’s largest international airline won the votes of thousands of global travellers, thanks to its world-class products, unmatched services, and superb value for money offerings. Thomas Ney, Divisional Senior Vice President Service Delivery at Emirates, accepted the awards at a ceremony held in Dubai at the Nikki Beach Club, attended by notable guests and leading members of the travel industry. Adel Al Redha, Emirates’ Chief Operating Officer, commented: “We’re delighted to be recognized again as one of the world’s best providers of luxury travel experiences. Emirates is renowned for always setting the bar high, and the past year has been no exception. We rolled out 10 A380 from our retrofit programme with completely new cabin interiors and Premium Economy seats, and expanded our global network to more than 140 destinations. We remain committed to continuously introducing innovative solutions and products to enhance our customers' journey. Thank you to our loyal customers for always choosing to fly better with us – and we look forward to raising the bar even higher!” Nick Perry, Chairman of Ultratravel, added: “As air travel among luxury travellers has returned in force after the pandemic, the competition at the top end of the market is continually increasing. The quality and quantity of choice available to affluent flyers is at its highest – so the achievement of Emirates to be voted the World’s Best Airline in 2023 is truly impressive. Emirates can be justly proud to retain top position for another year.” Emirates continues to invest in product and service enhancements to ensure customers have the best travel experience in the air and on-ground.

Emirates recently won the 2024 APEX World Class Airline for delivering outstanding customer service, and for showcasing the highest global standards of safety and well-being, sustainability, and service-guest experience. The airline also scooped a 2024 IFSA award for ‘Best Onboard Amenity,’ in recognition of the airline’s sustainable Economy Class amenity kit.

https://simpleflying.com/emirates-longest-nonstop-routes-boeing-777-2025/,Emirates’ Longest Nonstop Routes With The Boeing 777 In 2025,2025-09-29,"Emirates remains one of the world’s largest operators of the Boeing 777, and, in 2025, the twinjet continues to play a defining role in the carrier’s network. While the Airbus A380 often captures the spotlight as Emirates’ flagship, the 777 remains the workhorse of the airline. With its versatility, range, and reliability, the 777 serves destinations where the superjumbo would be either too large or operationally impractical. Emirates was founded in 1985 under CEO Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum and operates the Emirates Skywards loyalty program with IATA/ICAO code EK/UAE. Today, Emirates operates multiple variants of the Triple-Seven for different routes and reasons. It flies the Boeing 777-200LR, Boeing 777F, and Boeing 777-300ER, although the latter is by far the most prominent in its fleet. These aircraft enable Emirates to reach secondary markets as well as central hubs, often covering routes stretching over 8,000 miles. Emirates operates the world’s largest Boeing 777 fleet, with over 140 active aircraft in 2025. The bulk of this fleet consists of the 119 777-300ERs, a long-haul variant capable of seating more than 350 passengers in typical configurations. Alongside these, the airline also has a smaller number of 777-200LRs, which were primarily introduced to cover ultra-long-haul missions such as from Dubai to the United States. The airline has used the 777 extensively for more than two decades, steadily building a global network in which the aircraft is a backbone asset. The 777’s flexibility means it is equally comfortable flying shorter missions to South Asia as it is traversing transoceanic routes to North America or Australia. While Emirates is gradually preparing for the arrival of the next-generation 777X, its current fleet continues to drive much of the carrier’s daily operations. According to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company, Emirates has deployed the Boeing 777 on routes that generate billions of available seat miles annually. These routes are especially important where the Airbus A380 cannot be justified, such as secondary US cities or thinner Oceania markets. The United States represents one of the most important regions for Emirates’ Boeing 777 operations. The airline connects Dubai to several American cities with flights that stretch well beyond 7,000 miles (11,000 km), utilizing the 777’s long-range capabilities. Dubai to Dallas/Fort Worth is Emirates’ longest non-stop 777 service, covering 8,038 miles (12,936 km) and operating 366 times per year, providing 120,320 seats and generating 967 million ASMs. Dubai to Miami follows at 7,844 miles (12,624 km), producing over 955 million ASMs across 366 flights annually. Dubai to Orlando ranks third, spanning 7,754 miles (12,479 km) with 261 flights annually and more than 92,000 seats. Seattle’s route stretches 7,425 miles (11,949 km), operating 366 times annually with nearly 895 million ASMs, while Chicago O’Hare sits at 7,246 miles (11,661 km) and receives 366 flights annually, generating 859 million ASMs. The Boston connection covers 6,663 miles (10,723 km), providing 120,028 seats annually across 366 flights. Emirates also offers non-stop service from Dubai to Montréal on both the Boeing 777-300ER and 777-200LR. South America remains a challenging market for long-haul carriers, but Emirates has managed to establish a presence in Brazil. The Boeing 777 operates one of the airline’s longest flights to the region, namely from Dubai to Rio de Janeiro, covering 7,383 miles (11,882 km) with 280 flights annually and nearly 100,000 seats. This service complements Emirates’ São Paulo flights operated with an Airbus A380, while extending reach into Brazil’s cultural capital. In Australia, the Boeing 777 plays an essential role in serving several major cities. Dubai to Brisbane spans 7,442 miles (11,977 km) with 68 annual flights. Dubai to Melbourne is served 278 times annually, covering 7,230 miles (11,636 km), while Dubai to Adelaide covers 6,834 miles (10,998 km) with 334 flights annually and more than 100,000 seats. Emirates’ reliance on the Boeing 777 for ultra-long-haul services underscores the aircraft’s adaptability and economic efficiency, connecting Dubai to diverse markets, from US technology hubs to South American cultural centers and Australian metropolises. These routes highlight Emirates’ diversification strategy and the 777’s crucial belly cargo capacity that supports industries like pharmaceuticals and electronics. Cargo revenue was key for Emirates during the pandemic and continues to support profitability. Looking ahead, Emirates is preparing for the introduction of the Boeing 777X, with over 100 on order. The 777X promises greater range, improved fuel efficiency, and enhanced passenger amenities. It will eventually replace the 777-300ER on ultra-long-haul missions such as Dubai to Dallas, Miami, and Brisbane. Rival Gulf carriers like Etihad and Qatar Airways also plan to deploy advanced long-haul jets, ensuring competition remains intense. Until the 777X enters service, the 777-300ER remains Emirates’ primary workhorse for some of the longest flights in the world.",emirates remains one of the world’s largest operators of the boeing 777

https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/emirates-group-reports-record-profit-2023-24,Emirates Group reports record profit for 2023-24 | Aviation Week Network,2024-05-13,"The Emirates Group has released its 2023-24 Annual Report, hitting new record profit, revenue, and cash balance levels. Both Emirates and dnata saw significant profit and revenue increases in 2023-24, as the Group expanded its operations around the world to meet strong customer demand for its high-quality products and services. For the financial year ended 31 March 2024, the Emirates Group posted a record profit of AED 18.7 billion (US$ 5.1 billion), up 71% compared with an AED 10.9 billion (US$ 3.0 billion) profit for last year. The Group’s revenue was AED 137.3 billion (US$ 37.4 billion), an increase of 15% over last year’s results. The Group’s cash balance was AED 47.1 billion (US$ 12.8 billion), the highest ever reported, up 11% from last year. Combined Group profits for the last 2 years, at AED 29.6 billion, surpass pandemic losses of AED 25.9 billion during 2020-2022. His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates airline and Group said: “The Emirates Group has once again raised the bar to deliver a new record performance. Throughout the year, we saw high demand for air transport and travel related services around the world, and because we were able to move quickly to deliver what customers want, we achieved tremendous results. We are reaping the benefit of years of non-stop investments in our products and services, in building strong partnerships, and in the capabilities of our talented people. Huge credit is also due to the UAE’s visionary leaders, especially HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. It is thanks to their leadership and the nation’s progressive policies that the Emirates Group is able to flourish. Both Emirates and dnata have forged successful business models leveraging Dubai’s unique advantages, in turn generating enormous value for Dubai and the communities they serve around the world.” HH Sheikh Ahmed added: “The Group’s excellent financial standing today places us in a strong position for future growth and success. It enables us to invest to deliver even better products, services, and more value to our customers and stakeholders.” Many major projects are already underway, including: a multibillion-dollar aircraft fleet and cabin renewal programme; new catering, cargo, and ground handling capabilities; advanced technologies to support the Group’s operations; expanded training and people development programmes; and initiatives to progress the Group’s sustainability agenda. In 2023-24, the Group collectively invested AED 8.8 billion (US$ 2.4 billion) in new aircraft, facilities, equipment, companies, and the latest technologies to support its growth plans. The Group’s total workforce grew by 10% to 112,406 employees, its largest size ever, as Emirates and dnata continued recruitment activity around the world to support its expanding operations and bolster its future capabilities. The Group took significant strides in its sustainability journey during 2023-24, putting into action numerous initiatives focussed on the environment, its people, customers, and communities. Environmental topics were high on the agenda during the year, as the UAE hosted the world’s biggest conference for climate action, COP28, in Dubai. In 2023-24, Emirates signed new supply agreements to uplift sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at its Dubai hub for the very first time, and also in Amsterdam and Singapore. The airline operated the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% SAF in one engine, collecting data to support industry efforts to enable a future of 100% SAF flying. Recognising that airlines today have the limited viable solutions to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions, Emirates established a US$ 200 million fund to support R&D projects that focus on reducing the impact of fossil fuels in commercial aviation. It also became a founding entity of Air-CRAFT, a UAE-based research consortium for renewable and advanced aviation fuels; and joined The Solent Cluster, a UK initiative focused on producing low-carbon fuels for a variety of sectors, including aviation. dnata continued to invest and induct more electric and hybrid vehicles to its global fleet of ground support equipment (GSE), adding new baggage tractors, cargo loaders, and pushback tractors to its USA operations. It also converted and refurbished diesel-powered GSEs in Italy to run on Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil and electric power. dnata’s UAE businesses including dnata logistics, Arabian Adventures, Alpha Flight Services and City Sightseeing Worldwide, transitioned to biofuel for its landside fleet of vehicles. During the year, dnata became the first combined air services provider to receive the International Air Transport Association’s environmental management (IEnvA) certification for its commitment to sustainability across its UAE businesses; and Emirates achieved IEnvA Stage One and the IEnvA Illegal Wildlife Trade module certifications, for its efforts in environmental stewardship and anti-wildlife trafficking. The Group ramped up investments in people development, rolling out a comprehensive programme of learning and training options for its workforce in partnership with top universities and key industry partners. A Gender Balance Council was established to champion and promote gender equality within the Group. The Emirates Group has expanded its ESG reporting in its latest 2023-24 report and are adopting aspects of the GRI standards. It plans to evolve its reporting to meet ISSB and CSRD requirements in the coming years. Sheikh Ahmed said: “We enter our 2024-25 financial year on strong foundations for continued growth. Emirates will receive delivery of 10 new A350 aircraft in 2024-25, adding to our fleet mix and supporting the next phase of its network growth. dnata will continue to leverage synergies and scale across its business divisions to grow its footprint and capabilities.

https://simpleflying.com/emirates-relaunches-skywards-frequent-flyer-scheme-app/?,Emirates Frequent Flyers Can Now Earn Even More Skywards Miles,2023-05-25,"Emirates has expanded its Skywards scheme by relaunching an app that allows members to collect miles when making purchases at certain businesses across the UAE. Known as Skywards Everyday, the app represents an ideal opportunity for users to passively boost their points balance when shopping in the UAE. As announced by Emirates today, the relaunch of its Skywards Everyday app adds another layer to its diverse loyalty offering. Originally launched, as Business Traveller reported at the time, in December 2019, the revived mobile application is now available to download on both Android and iOS devices. But how does it work? As it happens, there are only a few steps that users must take in order to begin passively earning Emirates Skyward miles with their purchases. Once logged into the app, members can simply link up to five Visa or MasterCard debit or credit cards to their account, after which eligible purchases will see points earned. Love learning about points and miles? Read more of our loyalty news and guides here ! There are terms and conditions regarding whose cards can be registered from which countries. While Visa cards are valid worldwide, MasterCard holders must have had their card(s) issued in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, or the United States. The amount of Emirates Skywards miles that registered users can earn through the Skywards Everyday app depends on the type of purchases made. The Dubai-based UAE flag carrier explains that aspects such as "" high street shopping, leisure and entertainment, luxury shopping, beauty and wellness, services, and dining "" will see members rack up one mile per three UAE Dirham ($0.82) spent. Meanwhile, the ratio is less favorable for groceries and pharmacy shopping, as users need to spend five UAE Dirham ($1.36) in order to earn an Emirates Skywards mile. While qualifying purchases must be made in the UAE, this doesn't mean that the scheme is only open to UAE residents. Indeed, foreign visitors can also benefit from these opportunities, but only when spending money within the UAE. Get the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: Sign up for our newsletters today ! All in all, Emirates has partnered with more than 200 UAE-based businesses as part of its relaunched Skywards Everyday rewards scheme. As alluded to above, these are spread across a wide variety of sectors, meaning that there should be something for everyone in terms of places to passively earn extra Emirates Skywards miles. Emirates' Skywards frequent flyer scheme signed up its 30 millionth member in January - this gives the program a larger population than Australia ! As part of its announcement today, Emirates explained that these members have another opportunity to boost their mileage balances. They can do so by earning more miles per purchase when buying products and services with the Skywards credit card. What do you make of this addition to Emirates' loyalty offerings? Do you plan to use the Skywards Everyday app to boost your mileage balance? Let us know your thoughts in the comments!

The Airport maps can detect the user’s location (via Bluetooth and wifi) and provide point to point navigation through all touchpoints of the airport including check-in desks, Emirates lounges, shops, restaurants or ATMs in the airport. The Emirates app, supported in 19 languages, currently has 1.5 million active users each month and allows customers to search, book and manage their flights as well as their Emirates Skywards accounts. The new feature maps out Emirates’ hub — Dubai International Airport’s Terminal 3 — and also includes major airports in the Emirates network — London Heathrow, London Gatwick and Hong Kong International airport. Some 90 million passengers transit through Dubai International Airport each year and the wayfinding technology was introduced to provide convenience and a world class customer experience at every touchpoint of the Emirates journey. In the last year, the Emirates app was enhanced with new technology allowing customers to create bespoke playlists of their in-flight entertainment ahead of their travels and sync it to their seats once on board, providing a world-class travel experience. Last year, Emirates introduced 3D seat models, becoming the first airline to introduce web virtual reality (VR) technology on its digital platform. The 3D seat model is a visualisation engine that displays an immersive 3D 360 degree view of the interior of the Emirates A380 and all the Emirates B777 aircraft types.

https://simpleflying.com/emirates-offers-tips-fly-better-this-festive-season/?,Emirates Offers Tips To Fly Better This Festive Season,2024-12-10,"With its home base at one of the world's busiest airports, Middle Eastern airline giant Emirates is well aware of the need to keep its passengers moving smoothly through the airport process. The airline is already seeing passenger numbers up by around 20% compared to last year, and, in light of that, Emirates has published a range of strategies for its guests to navigate the process as stress-free as possible this holiday season. Yesterday, Emirates recommended that passengers plan their December travel well ahead of time as departure numbers have surged significantly ahead of the same time last year. In 2023, more than 75,000 Emirates customers departed Dubai International Airport (DXB) daily, but in 2024, departing numbers have reached as high as 89,000 on some days, an increase of close to 20%. Emirates will have its busiest departure days between December 12-15 and December 20-22, just before Christmas. That is expected to peak between December 27-29, just before New Year's Eve, when Emirates expects to see more than 88,000 customers depart daily. Emirates has now restored Australian capacity to pre-pandemic levels with 77 weekly flights. With those numbers on the board, the airline needs passengers to be at the gate and ready to board on time to keep its schedules moving. Taking a proactive approach, Emirates has published some helpful hints or reminders for its customers, starting with that golden rule of arriving at the airport up to three hours before their flight. Emirates is also doing everything it can to make the pre-departure process as flexible as possible by offering passengers a wide array of check-in and baggage drop options. These range from the Emirates City Check-In & Travel Store to newly-refurbished first and business class check-in areas at Dubai International, private home check-in services and remote check-in facilities. Dubai International has burst through 2019 levels and is well on its way to handling nearly 92 million passengers in 2024. Emirates has shared nine strategies that customers can employ to take away the pain of crowded airports and long queues, most of which include not turning up at the airport and then starting the process. Savvy passengers have learned the lesson that doing everything available in advance is the critical step to a smooth pathway to the check-in gate. Here is what Emirates suggests: If the above does not appeal, passengers can also use the Emirates self check-in kiosks at the airport to view their itinerary, choose a preferred seat, add Skywards numbers and use the baggage drop areas to check in bags. Emirates offers priority boarding for families as well as free baby strollers for infants and younger children at the Dubai airport. Passengers need to play their part by taking note of rules, such as power banks being allowed in hand baggage but not in checked bags and Smart bags being allowed in the cabin if the battery is removable and within the usual size and weight limits. The battery can remain installed as long as the Smart bag is completely powered off. Did you know we also have an aviation YouTube channel here? People of Determination can access dedicated support from trained Emirates and airport staff when traveling over the festive season. This includes a pre-planning guide for Dubai International for those with hidden disabilities, two hours of complimentary parking and access to a dedicated priority lane for check-in, passport control, security and priority boarding if required. Customers can check the Accessible Travel page on Emirates.com for information and contact their local Emirates office with queries. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved  And here's a bit of advice for Emirates. While I enjoyed travelling on your planes Dubai airport is a total disgrace. It's the one thing that deters me from flying with you. To have to navigate your way - as I did - from one side of the place to the other was a nightmare, especially as my flight from Cape Town was delayed by about an hour coming in from Dubai resulting in a mad dash to catch my London flight. Why are there no travelators there and why do you have to walk so far? Why do you have to go through security again when other airports keep you 'in transit'? I'm going to give DXB one last chance but will be very unhappy if the same happens again!",with its home base at one of the world s busiest airports middle eastern airline giant emirates is well aware

The app – branded as Emirates Skywards Go - operates on a subscription model, of sorts.  Members of the Skywards scheme need to pay 6,700 points to unlock the app for a month, at which point they have access to itinerary planning features and also a range of two-for-one discounts at restaurants, bars and spas in 20 cities worldwide. The Entertainer negotiates these deals directly with the merchants. The offers are distributed across its B2C site and also via a range of providers with whom it works as a B2B partner. The Emirates Skywards Go app is a white-labelled version of the core Entertainer product, branded as Emirates. The app will also sell tours and activities in 160 destinations. Some are contracted by the Entertainer with the majority pulled in via third party aggregators. The tours are bought using credit or debit cards rather than by redeeming points. By developing a model where people “pay” to access a trip-planning itinerary management tool, the partnership has addressed the biggest headwind in the sector by finding a way to monetize it. Whether or not people are paying for the tools, or simply for the discounts, is almost a moot point.

https://airfreight.news/articles/full/emirates-plane-flew-at-very-low-altitude-uae-investigators-say,"Emirates plane flew at very low altitude, UAE investigators say ",2022-02-17,"An Emirates flight to Washington failed to climb to the appropriate altitude during takeoff from Dubai and flew too low above a densely populated neighborhood, according to a preliminary report by aviation investigators. The shallow climb of the Boeing 777 on Dec. 19 was classified as “serious” in a preliminary report released Thursday by the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority. The incident didn’t result in any damage or injuries to the 372 on board. An Emirates spokesperson declined to comment on the report, the first of two recent close calls with the world’s biggest long-distance carrier. A safety probe is also under way into a Jan. 9 mishap in Dubai, when an Emirates 777 had to abort takeoff to Hyderabad, India, because another of the airline’s planes taxied across the runway. The pilot in the December flight said she placed the altitude selector to 4,000 feet, which is standard, after noticing it set to 0000 feet during cockpit preparation, according to the report. However, the rate of climb on the 777 aircraft only reached about 800 feet per minute. About 32 seconds after lift-off, two settings were changed, according to the report. The plane, carrying 354 passengers and 18 crew, gained altitude as it flew over the sea and continued on to Dulles International in the U.S. An overspeed warning was also generated after the plane gained airspeed.“The commander stated that after lift-off, and during climb, she followed the flight director command,” according to the report. “The flight crew were not able to adhere to published climb gradient of the SID due to the shallow climb,” it said, referring to standard instrument departure route, or the path set before takeoff. According to an earlier report in The Air Current, which cited Flightradar24 and a notice to Emirates pilots, the plane came within 175 feet of impacting the ground. The incident may have been due to “incorrect setting” of the autopilot in the plane’s pre-flight setup, it said. The UAE report said the cockpit voice recording was overwritten, without explaining how it happened. The investigation into the root cause, airline procedures and any other safety matters is ongoing.",an emirates flight to washington failed to climb to the appropriate altitude during takeoff from

https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/uae-flight-cancellations-emirates-flydubai-b1185675.html,UAE flight cancellations: Emirates and flydubai respond to 'regional unrest' | The Standard,2024-10-04,"News | World UAE airlines Emirates and flydubai have cancelled flights due to “regional unrest” as tensions in the Middle East reached boiling point. The airlines have cancelled all flights from Dubai to Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Emirates also cancelled flights on Thursday to the UK, Oman and Kuwait. Emirates later added that all flights to and from Iraq, Iran and Jordan scheduled for Friday and Saturday were also cancelled. The cancellations, which also occurred on Wednesday, came after the Israeli military confirmed that nearly 200 missiles had been launched from Iran into Israel. Flights to Lebanon’s capital Beirut have also been affected. Emirates has extended the suspension of routes to and from the city until Tuesday and flydubai until Monday Those travelling on these routes are encouraged to monitor flight statuses and be prepared for last-minute changes. “Customers transiting through Dubai with final destinations in Iraq, Iran, and Jordan will not be accepted for travel at their point of origin until further notice,” Emirates said in a travel update . “We continue to closely monitor the situation in the region and are in contact with the relevant authorities regarding developments.” The region is facing one of the most dangerous moments in history after Israel invaded Southern Lebanon , killing more than 1,000 people and targeting densely populated areas including Beirut. Israel said it was looking for Hezbollah targets, but it has also struck a medical centre and killed paramedics — and dozens of children across the country. Many, including United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, fear Israel’s incursion into Lebanon could become “another Gaza,” where at least 40,000 Palestinians have been killed. Iran said its retaliation was in response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Revolutionary Guard General Abbas Nilforushan. Skies were lit up with dozens of missiles on Tuesday evening. However, Israel’s Iron Dome system intercepted many, and there was just one fatality where a Palestinian man was killed by shrapnel. Despite international calls to end things before it is too late, Israeli authorities have vowed to respond. The escalating tensions call into question the operation of flight routes around the region. According to FlightRadar, 81 flights were diverted by 16 airlines on Tuesday when Iran launched its attack. Russia has also restricted flights from travelling to Israel, Iraq, and Iran between certain times as a result of the tension. Tourist hotspots such as Jordan (home to sites including Petra and Wadi Rum) are geographically positioned between Israel and Iran. Flight routes could be impacted if more attacks happen and airspace is forced to close. Dubai International Airport is considered the world’s busiest, facilitating thousands of flights weekly to worldwide destinations — including many Middle Eastern airports. Tourism within the entire region has already suffered due to the rapidly developing conflict, with many visitors rethinking whether upcoming trips are safe.

https://www.businessinsider.com/emirates-power-banks-fire-diversion-lithium-battery-2025-8,"Emirates Cracks Down Power Banks, After a Fire and Diversion - Business Insider",2025-08-08,"Emirates is the latest airline to crack down on power banks. From October, passengers won't be able to charge them or use them to charge other devices. Several airlines have introduced restrictions since one caught fire on an Air Busan flight in January. Emirates has become the latest and largest airline to crack down on power banks. The Dubai-based carrier announced Friday that using such devices will be prohibited on board its flights, starting October 1. Though many other airlines have cracked down on the use of power banks after one caught fire on a flight in January, Emirates' rules are among the strictest. Passengers won't be allowed to charge devices with power banks, nor charge a power bank itself using a plane's outlets. They're also only allowed one, which must be under 100 Wh, and stored in the seat pocket or a bag under the seat in front, not the overhead bin. It joins Southwest Airlines, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways, among others. Authorities in Hong Kong and South Korea have also instituted rules about power banks on planes. Why airlines are cracking down on power banks On any airline, power banks must be carried in the cabin and not left in checked baggage, so cabin crew can intervene quickly to stop a fire from getting out of control. The dangers were spotlighted in January, when an Air Busan Airbus A321 caught fire before takeoff in South Korea. All 176 people aboard survived, but 27 were injured. Investigators said the fire was likely caused by a power bank, and the South Korean government announced stricter rules around their usage. Emirates said on Friday: ""There has been a significant growth in customers using power banks in recent years, resulting in an increasing number of lithium battery-related incidents on board flights across the wider aviation industry."" In May, a Southwest plane was forced to divert when a customer's battery charger overheated on a flight from Baltimore to Tampa. It occurred just 24 hours after the airline instituted new rules requiring customers to keep power banks visible while in use. The Southwest flight attendants followed procedures and put the device in a containment bag. The plane landed safely in South Carolina, where passengers had to wait five hours before continuing their journey on a new plane. Power banks are particularly risky because of their lithium batteries. If overcharged or damaged, it can result in thermal runaway, leading to rapid temperature increase. Unlike phones and laptops, many power banks don't have safeguards against this. Emirates has the fourth-largest network in the world by seat miles, behind only the US's Big Three. Its decision suggests more airlines could follow suit.",emirates is the latest airline to crack down on power banks from october passengers won t be able to charge them or use them to charge other

FILE - An Emirates Airbus A380 jumbo jet lands at Dubai International Airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Friday, Sept. 9, 2022. The long-haul carrier Emirates announced Monday, May 13, 2024, it saw record profits of $4.7 billion in 2023 as the airline fully took flight after the turbulent years of the coronavirus pandemic disrupted its operations.(AP Photo/Jon Gambrell, File) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The long-haul carrier Emirates announced Monday it saw record profits of $4.7 billion in 2023 as the airline fully took flight after the turbulent years of the coronavirus pandemic disrupted its operations. Emirates, owned by Dubai’s government, announced revenues of $33 billion, compared to $29.3 billion the year before. Profit the year prior had been $2.9 billion. The airline carried 51.9 million passengers in its 2023 financial year, as compared to 43.6 million the year prior. “Throughout the year, we saw high demand for air transport and travel related services around the world, and because we were able to move quickly to deliver what customers want, we achieved tremendous results,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and CEO of Emirates, said in a statement. “We are reaping the benefit of years of non-stop investments in our products and services, in building strong partnerships, and in the capabilities of our talented people.” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, praised the airline, noting it “took off 39 years ago and the world of aviation is no longer what it was before.” “What is coming will be more beautiful, greater and better, God willing,” Sheikh Mohammed wrote on the social platform X. The Emirates’ results track with those for its base, Dubai International Airport . The world’s busiest airport for international travelers had 86.9 million passengers last year, surpassing numbers for 2019 just before the coronavirus pandemic grounded global aviation. The airport had 89.1 million passengers in 2018 — its busiest-ever year before the pandemic.  The airport now plans to move to the city-state’s second, sprawling airfield in its southern desert reaches in the next 10 years in a project worth nearly $35 billion . The overall Emirates Group, which includes travel company dnata, as well as food, beverage and leisure holdings, reported profits of $5.1 billion off revenues of $37.4 billion. The group declared a dividend to its owner, the sheikhdom’s sovereign wealth fund known as the Investment Corporation of Dubai, of $1 billion. It also gave its over 112,000 employees 20-weeks bonus pay, according to an internal email sent to staff seen by The Associated Press. The city-state, one of seven hereditarily ruled, autocratic sheikhdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates, provided Emirates some $4 billion in a bailout at the height of the pandemic . The annual report said Emirates had repaid $2.6 billion of that loan during the last financial year. In November, Emirates announced a $52 billion deal to purchase 90 Boeing 777 aircraft, 55 of them 777-9 variants and 35 of them 777-8s. Emirates will also add an additional five 787 Dreamliners to its previous order of 30 aircraft. For years, Emirates has relied on the Boeing 777 and the double-decker Airbus A380 to ferry passengers around the world. That will change in September, when Emirates says it will begin flying the Airbus A350 on routes. The airline has also embarked on a $2 billion retrofit program for its aircraft. But challenges remain for the carrier. Saudi Arabia plans to push into the market with Riyadh Air, a new carrier that made a jet deal valued around $37 billion with Boeing just last year with the flagship carrier Saudia. Climate change may be another concern as well — the wider UAE saw its heaviest recorded rainfall ever last month , which disrupted Emirates’ flights for days.     Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The incident is thought to have occurred on an Emirates flight from Dubai to Islamabad on Sunday morning, according to Amir Mateen, a Pakistani journalist who published the footage online. The man was alleged to have been ""drunk"" and ""extremely violent,"" Mateen said, quoting a person on board. Further footage shows the man detained in an airport wheelchair, although the exact whereabouts are unclear. Newsweek approached Emirates via email for comment on Monday. Loading twitter content... In the footage, the man can be seen attempting to headbutt a male member of the flight crew before being pushed to the floor with the assistance of another. A female flight attendant can then be seen passing them a pair of cable ties commonly used by airlines to restrain potentially violent passengers. Another angle then shows the man on the floor being held down by the two male flight attendants while two female flight attendants appear to restrain his legs with cable ties. In the second clip, the man sits hunched over in a wheelchair in a sky bridge with his hands tied behind his back while a male flight attendant appears to be attaching his legs to the wheelchair. ""Drink some water,"" a passer-by is heard telling him. Earlier this month, two men were detained after a fight broke out between them mid-air on a Southwest Airlines flight from California to Hawaii. In January, onboard footage captured the moment a passenger charged the pilot of an IndiGo flight from New Delhi, India to Goa. His anger was said to be at an extended delay. In December, a man was seen being detained by the authorities and attempting to punch police officers while being dragged from the plane prior to departure on a Spirit Airlines flight from Barranquilla, Colombia, to Miami, Florida. The airline said in a statement the man had been removed after becoming ""unruly"" and ""aggressive."" Before that, a passenger was reported to have attacked a flight attendant on a flight from Miami to New York, leaving her unconscious in a pool of blood. The alleged assault occurred on the sky bridge and led to the flight being delayed by several hours. According to the International Air Transport Association, in 2023 there was approximately one incident involving an unruly passenger for every 835 flights, with not complying with flight crew instructions being the most common description.

https://scw-mag.com/news/exploring-the-aviation-industrys-challenges-and-emirates-strategic-responses/,Exploring the Aviation Industry's Challenges and Emirates' Strategic Responses,2023-12-04,"The global aviation industry is facing a critical juncture, with significant challenges including heightened travel demand, climate change, operational safety, and technological advancements. Emirates Airline President Tim Clark has expressed concern over the industry’s readiness to tackle these challenges over the next two to three decades. He fears signs of failure in providing adequate infrastructure for the future, coupled with a lack of industry leadership, indicating a dire need for proactive measures. A key issue highlighted by Clark is the repeated delays in aircraft deliveries from major manufacturers like Boeing . This is particularly problematic for Emirates as they ramp up operations to meet surging travel demand in the post-pandemic era. Clark questions the accountability and oversight of these manufacturers, especially in the context of Boeing’s years-long delays with its 777X programme, which significantly impacts Emirates’ fleet plans. These supply chain issues, extending to the sourcing of raw materials and parts, are a major concern for the industry. The recent resurgence in travel demand has also exposed shortcomings at many airports, which failed to anticipate the swift recovery post-pandemic. Clark highlights the chaotic situations at airports like Heathrow and Schiphol, underscoring the industry’s struggle to cope with current demands, let alone future growth. This scenario underscores the need for substantial investments in airport infrastructure and modern air navigation systems. Safety concerns, such as those triggered by the 5G wireless rollout in the US, have raised questions about the industry’s preparedness for such challenges. Clark also points to the need for more skilled aviation workers and emphasizes the importance of addressing cybersecurity threats, mental health support, and sustainable flying practices. The industry, according to Clark, requires significant investment in support programmes to build a skilled workforce capable of matching advancements in areas like electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles. In response to these industry-wide challenges, Emirates is taking decisive steps. Clark expresses growing confidence in the development and certification of Boeing’s 777-9, expecting it to receive Type Inspection Authorization around February 2024. This confidence is underscored by Emirates’ order for 90 more 777X jets. Emirates has also announced a $950 million investment in a new ultra-modern engineering facility at Dubai World Central. This facility, designed to support Emirates’ fleet into the 2040s, will serve as a centre of excellence for commercial aviation engineering services in the Middle East. This significant investment signals Emirates’ confidence in the future growth of both the airline and the broader aviation sector. Despite ongoing supply chain issues affecting the refurbishment of its Airbus A380s, Emirates remains resilient, with plans to add 20-30 more A380s to its fleet. Clark notes the importance of not being held at the mercy of supply chains or manufacturers, highlighting the need for operational flexibility. He expects a return to some normality in the aircraft supply chain by mid-2024. Emirates’ robust approach is also evident in its order of 165 new aircraft, with more anticipated, showcasing its commitment to meeting future air travel demands, particularly in leisure travel. Emirates’ strategic responses to the aviation industry’s challenges reflect a deep understanding of the sector’s complexities and a commitment to innovation and resilience. As the industry navigates through turbulent times, Emirates’ actions, from increasing its fleet to investing in state-of-the-art facilities, set a precedent for how airlines can adapt and thrive in an ever-evolving landscape.

https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/emirates-flight-cancellations-typhoon-ragasa,Emirates cancels Dubai flights to Hong Kong and Shenzhen as Super Typhoon Ragasa approaches | Time Out Dubai,2025-09-24,"This article was last updated at 2:30pm on Wednesday September 24 Emirates has cancelled two major coastal routes this week as East Asia braces for Super Typhoon Ragasa. The world’s largest international airline has cancelled its popular routes from Dubai International Airport to Hong Kong and Shenzhen on Tuesday September 23, Wednesday September 24 and Thursday September 25. The cancellations come as the two cities prepare for the category five Typhoon RAGASA-25 (Nando) , which has already hit several countries in East and Southeast Asia. Super Typhoon Ragasa has packed winds of 215km/ph, with gusts of up to 295km/ph and reached heights exceeding nine feet when it hit the Philippines. As a pre-emptive measure, Emirates has cancelled several scheduled flights due to travel from DXB this week as well as a shuttle service between Bangkok and Hong Kong on September 23 and 24. The cancellations also affect flights due to travel from Hong Kong and Shenzhen to DXB on the same days. In a travel update on the Emirates site , the airline has outlined that a total of 12 flights are cancelled, and they can be seen below: The airline has also said that anyone travelling through Dubai with final destinations of Hong Kong and Shenzhen will not be accepted for travel at their point of origin until further notice. Anyone affected by the flight cancellations is asked to contact their travel agency for rebooking or to get in touch with the airline directly . Passengers who were due to travel have been asked to ensure that their contact details are correct by visiting the Manage Your Booking section of the airline’s website to receive updates. Emirates has also apologised for any inconvenience and will continue to monitor the situation closely. Routes to the Southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, operated by both Emirates and China Southern Airlines , continue to operate as normal from Dubai International Airport.  It was snowing on the day that Findlay left Scotland so it's fair to say there's been a big adjustment to life in Dubai.

All Rights Reserved. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. FILE - An Emirates Airbus A380 jumbo jet lands at Dubai International Airport in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Friday, Sept. 9, 2022. The long-haul carrier Emirates announced Monday, May 13, 2024, it saw record profits of $4.7 billion in 2023 as the airline fully took flight after the turbulent years of the coronavirus pandemic disrupted its operations.(AP Photo/Jon Gambrell, File) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The long-haul carrier Emirates announced Monday it saw record profits of $4.7 billion in 2023 as the airline fully took flight after the turbulent years of the coronavirus pandemic disrupted its operations. Emirates, owned by Dubai’s government, announced revenues of $33 billion, compared to $29.3 billion the year before. Profit the year prior had been $2.9 billion. The airline carried 51.9 million passengers in its 2023 financial year, as compared to 43.6 million the year prior. “Throughout the year, we saw high demand for air transport and travel related services around the world, and because we were able to move quickly to deliver what customers want, we achieved tremendous results,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and CEO of Emirates, said in a statement. “We are reaping the benefit of years of non-stop investments in our products and services, in building strong partnerships, and in the capabilities of our talented people.” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, praised the airline, noting it “took off 39 years ago and the world of aviation is no longer what it was before.” “What is coming will be more beautiful, greater and better, God willing,” Sheikh Mohammed wrote on the social platform X. The Emirates’ results track with those for its base, Dubai International Airport . The world’s busiest airport for international travelers had 86.9 million passengers last year, surpassing numbers for 2019 just before the coronavirus pandemic grounded global aviation. The airport had 89.1 million passengers in 2018 — its busiest-ever year before the pandemic.  The airport now plans to move to the city-state’s second, sprawling airfield in its southern desert reaches in the next 10 years in a project worth nearly $35 billion . The overall Emirates Group, which includes travel company dnata, as well as food, beverage and leisure holdings, reported profits of $5.1 billion off revenues of $37.4 billion. The group declared a dividend to its owner, the sheikhdom’s sovereign wealth fund known as the Investment Corporation of Dubai, of $1 billion. It also gave its over 112,000 employees 20-weeks bonus pay, according to an internal email sent to staff seen by The Associated Press. The city-state, one of seven hereditarily ruled, autocratic sheikhdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates, provided Emirates some $4 billion in a bailout at the height of the pandemic . The annual report said Emirates had repaid $2.6 billion of that loan during the last financial year. In November, Emirates announced a $52 billion deal to purchase 90 Boeing 777 aircraft, 55 of them 777-9 variants and 35 of them 777-8s. Emirates will also add an additional five 787 Dreamliners to its previous order of 30 aircraft. For years, Emirates has relied on the Boeing 777 and the double-decker Airbus A380 to ferry passengers around the world. That will change in September, when Emirates says it will begin flying the Airbus A350 on routes. The airline has also embarked on a $2 billion retrofit program for its aircraft. But challenges remain for the carrier. Saudi Arabia plans to push into the market with Riyadh Air, a new carrier that made a jet deal valued around $37 billion with Boeing just last year with the flagship carrier Saudia. Climate change may be another concern as well — the wider UAE saw its heaviest recorded rainfall ever last month , which disrupted Emirates’ flights for days.     Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

https://nypost.com/2025/09/10/world-news/emirates-makes-controversial-change-to-kids-rule-in-first-class/,Emirates makes controversial change to kids' rule in First Class,2025-09-10,"Emirates has made a huge change to its First Class Cabin – and it’s not the best news for parents with young kids. For anyone who books the luxe cabin using Skywards Miles – whether it’s a full award ticket or an upgrade – can no longer use it on kids aged eight and under. The policy was implemented as of August 15, 2025; however, it does not apply to tickets paid with cash, according to One Mile at a Time . The change is only a limitation on accessing the cabin through miles, with the Dubai-based airline being the only known carrier to enforce this rule. Many have weighed in on the new policy online, with some confused why it doesn’t extend to tickets paid with cash, too. “The only controversial part of this is only applying this to the miles redemptions,” one person argued. “Not allowing kids in the first class is absolutely logical, and all airlines should have such a policy, but when an airline only does it in instances where it doesn’t hurt their bottom line, it becomes clear that customer experience is not the reason why they do it.” Some pointy-end flyers agreed with the policy, saying: “I do not want to have my first class experience ruined by the noise of a small child. I paid money for a quiet, lovely experience.” The terms and conditions of the Skywards program have been updated to read: “Please note that passengers aged 8 years old and below are ineligible for First Class Emirates Classic Rewards and Upgrade Rewards,” according to One Mile at a Time. The change has ignited a heated discussion on whether kids should be allowed on flights altogether, as some described the airline’s move as “sad.” “Honestly, I believe that kids should not be allowed in first class,” one woman wrote on Instagram. “The last couple times I flew internationally, we had infants in first class that cried the whole time. I don’t want to be around that. I don’t want to hear your kid screaming. I am paying for a relaxing a comfortable flight, and you bringing your infant or small child into first class ruins that for everyone.” Her comment was met with immediate frustration. “Maybe it’s time you get your own private jet before complaining about sharing PUBLIC transport with the PUBLIC. Believe it or not, children count. I’m pretty sure the parent of the screaming child found that flight far harder than you did, where you can simply ignore, pop in some headphones or earplugs and get on with your journey,” a user hit back. Another parent also fired back, saying, “Some of you might want to stop your celebratory dance. I can promise you those of us who can afford to fly our kids in business class aren’t just using miles to book our tickets. My toddler will see you on your next flight.” A mom said that as a parent, she wishes there were ‘family-only’ flights. “People can be so awful toward families, as you can see in this comment section. I promise you, the last thing I want is for my child to be crying, loud, or bothering anyone on a plane,” she explained. “It’s actually incredibly stressful for us, too. And I’m not even talking about business class.” Some airlines have made adjustments to their cabins. For example, Turkish-Dutch carrier Corendon Airlines has introduced an “Only Adult” zone on board its Airbus A350 jets. The section is for flying between the Netherlands’ capital, Amsterdam, and the Dutch Caribbean island Curaçao. It is about a 10-hour flight. “The Only Adult zone is located in the front area of the plane, and is only accessible to passengers of 16 years and up,” the airline states on its site. “The Only Adult zone is separated — both you and happy kids will stay happy travellers.” Scoot has a ‘ScootinSilence’ cabin situated in the forward section of its Boeing 787 aircraft. “Exclusively for passengers aged 12 and above, this quiet zone offers enhanced comfort with generous legroom, with a seat pitch of 33-34 inches on the 787-9, and adjustable headrests,” its website states. AirAsia X’s Quiet Zone is for guests aged 10 years and above. “Quiet Zone seating is available on selected flights operated by Airbus A330 aircraft. These zones are designed for passengers seeking a more serene flying experience with minimal noise,” it states. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.

https://simpleflying.com/emirates-airbus-a380-new-york-emergency-landing/,Emirates A380 Makes Emergency Landing in NYC on 3 Engines,2025-07-15,"Reports have emerged concerning an Emirates flight to New York last month whose landing in the Big Apple was more eventful than might otherwise have been expected to be the case. Operated by an Airbus A380 , the double-decker quadjet with which the UAE flag carrier has become almost synonymous over the years, the flight was forced to declare an emergency following an engine shutdown. Thankfully, the superjumbo landed safely in New York , with its remaining three engines having given it more than enough redundancy to avoid needing to divert and land elsewhere with more haste. Still, the incident looks to have had a considerable operational impact on the aircraft involved, given that it remained on the ground for a week in the US before returning to service. Let's examine what happened. Emirates flight EK203 is a regularly scheduled commercial passenger flight that originates at the Middle Eastern airline's Dubai International Airport (DXB) hub. Its destination is New York JFK Airport in the United States of America, with this being one of two daily flights currently operated on this route by Emirates. Departing at 02:50 and arriving at 08:50, EK203 has a scheduled block time of 14 hours. According to recent reporting by the Aviation Herald , the iteration of Emirates flight EK203 on June 28 of this year was somewhat more eventful than the average rotation on this corridor. While, at face value, the tracking data from Flightradar24 that shows that it departed at 03:15 and landed at 08:58 suggests that the flight operated more or less to plan, the reality was a little bit more on the alarming side. Specifically, an engine issue is said to have prompted the crew to shut down the left outboard Rolls-Royce Trent 972 engine of the Airbus A380 operating the flight, after which they declared an emergency. Commentary on the Aviation Herald suggests that the aircraft was still more than two hours away from New York JFK Airport at the time, which may lead some to question why the superjumbo didn't divert. However, while they have largely faded into obscurity in recent years , one of the key benefits of quadjet commercial passenger aircraft such as the Airbus A380 is the fact that, if an engine is shut down, they still have three more to play with. This gives them considerably more redundancy in such situations than aircraft that only have two engines, such as the A350s and Boeing 777s that Emirates also flies. As such, despite needing to declare an emergency in light of the unplanned engine shutdown onboard Emirates flight EK203 on June 28, the crew were able to fly the quadjet all the way to New York as planned. There, the Aviation Herald notes, the aircraft, which had 450 people onboard, landed safely on runway 22L at JFK. According to ch-aviation , the Airbus A380 in question (A6-EUW) has 484 seats onboard, split between 338 in economy, 56 in premium economy, 76 in business, and 14 in first class in what aeroLOPA notes is known as a four-class ultra-long-range configuration. Simple Flying has reached out to Emirates for more information regarding this incident, and we will update this article when a statement is received. The Dubai-based carrier continues to buy up its leased A380s. A quick look at tracking data made available by Flightradar24 shows that, normally, the Airbus A380 operating Emirates flight EK203 only spends around two-and-a-half hours on the ground in New York before returning to Dubai at 11:20 as EK204. However, for A6-EUW, the wait to fly back home was considerably longer. Indeed, as a result of the incident, the return flight on June 28 was canceled, and, in fact, it would be a week before the stricken superjumbo took to the skies again. This would eventually come to pass the following Saturday, on July 5, with a ferry flight. Specifically, the aircraft returned to Dubai under the rarely used positioning flight number EK2692. Having taken to the skies over New York at 09:09 the Saturday before last, it touched back down at its home base 11 hours and 50 minutes later at 04:59 the following morning. Its first passenger flight thereafter was to Sydney. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved  This isn’t the first time the Trent 900 failed badly And will not be the last it doesn't say anywhere that it failed ""badly"" only that it had been shut down. That could mean a various number of things not necessarily major issues but why risk more severe damage when you have 3 more? A week on the ground would suggest it was a spare parts issue rather than an off wing job. Not sure however if Emirates have any spare Trents laying around at JFK in which case an engine switch could be done in said time....maybe chris I hope EK has spares Kinda seems like GE has a reliability edge over both RR and PW at the moment.   I hope that both are able to make improvements soon. Just read the other day, several airlines are switching from RR to GE.  I think PW is down to about 25% or less of commercial engines. Engine Alliance GP7200 >>> Trent 900 Also quieter as well Qantas 32 all over. Not surprising airlines are swapping to GE. BA have had reliability problems with the A380’s I wonder if that is Rolls Royce related Not a big deal. I remember about 15 years ago, a BA 744 took off from LAX and had an engine failure shortly thereafter. BA flew the plane all the way to LHR. IIRC, it flew at a much lower altitude however. I believe it also diverted to Manchester. Emirates, one of the safest Airlines in the world, Easy to say when they’ve only been around 40yrs Hardly pioneers in aviation… Why the call sign became Emirates 8ER rather than Emirates 203 over Long Island on New York approach? because of the emergency declaration? What happened to the passengers waiting to ride her for the next 5-7 days? Go Pratt and Whitney Why suddenly many aircrafts engines started giving problems forcthe last few months??? Any sabotage worldwide ? Very scaring ?? If you want to see the much higher frequency of flight incidents than reported by SF, subscribe to Aeroinside Is it possible that the A380 has now way pasted their use by date . If an A380 goes down it a huge loss on one type aircraft.",reports have emerged concerning an emirates flight to new york last month whose landing in the big apple was more eventful than might

https://www.icthealth.org/news/emirates-improves-in-flight-digital-medical-care?,Emirates improves in-flight digital medical care | ICT&health Global,2025-03-18,"A medical emergency en route is always a challenge, but especially when it occurs on an airplane. Depending on the severity of the emergency, the pilot will have to decide whether an unscheduled layover is necessary, with all the consequences and costs that entails. While most aircraft have a comprehensive first aid kit, medication and defibrillator, there certainly isn't always a doctor on board. Airline Emirates is now investing in new, state-of-the-art, medical equipment that will allow on-board staff to provide passengers with better care, such as by consulting with medics on the ground via video call. Over the next few years, 300 Emirates aircraft will be equipped with Parsys Telemedicine mobile medical stations. The system, specifically for use in aircraft, was developed and put together in cooperation with the airline. Part of the Parsys system includes 12-lead Telecardia ECG equipment, a pulse oximeter, thermometer, blood pressure monitor, glucometer and a telemedicine station that not only allows measurement data to be sent from the patient to a doctor or hospital, but also provides the ability to make a video call to a medical specialist on the ground. Passengers in need of medical attention can now have their vital signs or measurements automatically transmitted via Bluetooth to the Medcapture device, eliminating the need for cabin crew to take notes and transmit information manually. The medical equipment is operated by the cabin crew. Apart from extensive first aid training, they usually have no specialized medical knowledge. For this purpose, the supplier and Emirates have set up a ground team that is available 24/7 - in accordance with the airline's flight schedule - to provide real-time support. In addition, cabin crew, who are already trained to assist with medical emergencies such as CPR, use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) and even help with childbirth, will also be trained to operate the new medical equipment. In its development, much attention was paid to the user-friendliness of the tablet's interface. It can, Emirates claims, be operated efficiently even under difficult conditions. Together with Parsys, a fully digitized and automated solution has been developed that streamlines communication and treatment. First success Meanwhile, the first aircraft have already been equipped with a Parsys system, and with it, a number of onboard medical emergencies have already been resolved, without the need for an unplanned stopover. For example, Emrirates cites “a medical emergency that affected [a passenger's] cardiovascular system, leading to a significant drop in her oxygen level.” The kit allowed cabin crew to provide medical assistance based on communication with the ground team. The collaboration between Emirates and Parsys is not the first of its kind. In 2021, Philips and Airbus signed an agreement to equip Airbus Corporate Jets business aircraft with Philips medical monitoring equipment. This allowed the aircraft crew to monitor the vital signs of travelers. The data collected with this form of medical monitoring could also be sent directly to doctors or other medical support personnel on the ground.",a medical emergency en route is always a challenge but

Chicago O’Hare, being one of the busiest airports in the US, has had to deal with rerouted passengers and delayed international flights as a result. Chicago to Dubai : The return leg of Flight UAE9393 from Brussels to Chicago was also canceled, affecting passengers traveling from Chicago to Dubai. Impact on Passengers Passenger Frustration Passengers affected by these cancellations and delays have expressed frustration due to the lack of timely updates, limited customer service options, and difficulties in rescheduling flights. Many passengers were left without adequate compensation or immediate rebooking options, forcing them to rework their travel plans, book new flights, or face the inconvenience of waiting for further updates. A particularly poignant example of frustration comes from passengers who were set to fly on the now-canceled Flight UAE9393 . These individuals were stranded at Brussels Airport, left without a clear alternative route to reach their destinations. The cancellation of this flight left a significant number of travelers in a lurch, especially those connecting to other international destinations. Alternative Arrangements In some cases, Emirates has worked to rebook passengers on alternative flights, though this process has been slow and often results in long wait times for those affected. Several passengers who had planned to travel on Flight UAE9393 were redirected to other available flights, though this has meant longer layovers and fewer options. Many passengers have opted to book alternative carriers due to the lack of availability on Emirates’ rebooked flights. Steps Taken by Emirates Emirates has assured passengers that they are working to resolve the situation and minimize the impact on affected travelers. The airline has committed to offering refunds for canceled flights, as well as rebooking affected travelers on the next available flights. The airline has also provided additional support at key airports, including Brussels, Chicago, and Dubai, where disrupted passengers can seek assistance and find new booking options. However, due to the high volume of affected passengers, many travelers are still waiting for full resolution. Emirates’ Response to the Crisis In a statement, Emirates expressed regret over the cancellations and delays and assured passengers that they are working tirelessly to get operations back to normal. The airline’s spokesperson stated: “We sincerely apologize to all our valued passengers who have been affected by these flight disruptions. We understand the inconvenience this has caused, and we are actively working to rebook affected passengers and offer alternative travel options. We appreciate our customers’ patience and understanding during this challenging period.” While these steps are in place, many passengers remain frustrated by the lack of immediate clarity regarding rebooking and refunds. Weather-related delays, along with operational challenges, have made it difficult for the airline to provide quick solutions for all travelers. Emirates is facing a significant operational challenge, with cancellations and delays affecting key international routes between Belgium, the United States, and the UAE. Weather-related disruptions and operational challenges, including aircraft maintenance and scheduling, have led to these extensive delays. While the airline has committed to rebooking passengers and offering refunds, the ongoing disruption is testing both the airline’s reputation and the patience of its passengers.

According to video footage reviewed by Bloomberg News, confusion in the cabin turned into commotion as travelers paced the aisles, checked their phones, and urged flight attendants to let them off the Airbus A380. The flight, EK226, was scheduled for a 15-hour journey to Dubai International Airport.

All we ask is that if you wish to offload yourself, you do so,” he said. While passengers are not usually permitted to leave once cabin doors are closed, the unusual circumstances forced Emirates to allow flexibility. Trump’s decision has unsettled many of the more than 70% of H-1B visa holders who are Indian nationals, most employed by Indian IT companies. The administration said the fee hike is aimed at strengthening legitimate applications and curbing misuse. However, the lack of clarity prompted large technology firms including Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to caution their employees against foreign travel.

India is also the top destination for travelers from Dubai International Airport, one of the busiest transit hubs globally. It remains unclear how many passengers chose to leave the plane. Flight-tracking site Flightradar24 reported that the aircraft eventually departed after a delay of three hours and 40 minutes.

Abdullah Hussain, an aircraft enthusiast from Birmingham, said he saw the plane make ""quite a rough landing"". He said he believed ""a front tyre looked damaged and flat"". A source close to the airport said the Emirates aircraft had a problem with its brakes, but no one was hurt and there had not been a fire. The Airbus A380 is one of the world's largest passenger aircraft, carrying 615 people, and only recently returned to Birmingham Airport after not being seen there since before the pandemic. It serves a twice daily route between the city and Dubai. Mr Hussain said he had seen A380 land a number of times and ""normally glides really well"", so it was clear to him that this was ""not a normal sort of landing"". ""A whole bunch of then fire engines and other vehicles then came out"", he said. Emirates said the flight, from Dubai to Birmingham, made a safe landing and was then ""attended by emergency services and maintenance technicians as there were reports of smoke during taxiing"". It said: ""A technical issue was identified, engines were shut down as a precaution and the aircraft was towed to a remote stand. ""Passengers and crew safely disembarked.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62163254,Emirates refuses Heathrow's demand to cut flights,2022-07-14,"Emirates has rejected Heathrow Airport's demands for airlines to stop selling summer tickets, calling the move ""unreasonable and unacceptable"". The airline accused the airport of having a ""blatant disregard"" for customers after it capped passenger numbers to 100,000 per day over summer. Emirates said the airport now faced ""an 'airmageddon' situation due to their incompetence and non-action"". Heathrow said it had no choice but to bring in a cap on departing travellers. ""For months we have asked airlines to help come up with a plan to solve their resourcing challenges, but no clear plans were forthcoming and with each passing day the problem got worse,"" the UK's largest airport said. Emirates said it was given 36 hours to cut departing passenger numbers, and therefore flights, and was threatened with legal action for not complying. ""This is entirely unreasonable and unacceptable, and we reject these demands,"" it added. In a statement heavily criticising Heathrow management, Emirates accused the airport of choosing ""not to act, not to plan, not invest"" and said its new cap on passengers appeared to have been ""plucked from thin air"". ""They wish to force Emirates to deny seats to tens of thousands of travellers who have paid for, and booked months ahead, their long-awaited package holidays or trips to see their loved ones,"" the airline said, citing that people were desperate to travel after two years of pandemic restrictions. It added it planned to operate flights to and from the airport as scheduled. The cap on passenger numbers at Heathrow Airport will be in place from now until 11 September. Before the pandemic, up to 125,000 people a day departed from the airport. The BBC has seen a letter from the Civil Aviation Authority, which regulates airports, to Heathrow asking airport bosses to explain - by midday on Friday - why it has introduced a passenger cap and what it means for each terminal. Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, with many having to deal with last-minute flight cancellations. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up and there are concerns travellers will be hit by further disruption and delays to journeys. Emirates is clearly furious. While airlines haven't always enjoyed a smooth relationship with Heathrow, arguing over charges for example, this is in a different league. Accusing the airport operator of incompetence, blatant disregard for consumers, creating a mess that airlines and passengers have to sort out... it isn't pulling any punches here. Emirates is in a difficult position. It relies on carrying large numbers of passengers in big planes from London to Dubai, where most of them fly on to other long-haul destinations. So every flight cut matters - and Emirates thinks it shouldn't have to cut them. It isn't the only airline saying this sort of thing, either. Others have been very vocal behind the scenes as well. Emirates claims Heathrow has threatened legal action if it doesn't comply with the demand to cut flights - but says it has no intention of doing so. The gloves are off. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for international travel has returned. But Emirates said its ground handling and catering staff were ""fully ready and capable"" of handling its scheduled flights, claiming the ""crux of the issue lies with the central services and systems which are the responsibility of the airport operator"". ""They are pushing the entire burden - of costs and the scramble to sort the mess - to airlines and travellers,"" its statement said. ""All the signals of a strong travel rebound were there."" The airline said that as international travel had recovered over the past year, it had rehired and trained 1,000 pilots. The carrier also said it seen ""regularly high seat loads"" so ""our operational requirements cannot be a surprise to the airport"". It said rebooking passengers was ""impossible"" with all of its flights at full capacity over the next few weeks, which included services at other London airports and on other airlines. ""Moving some of our passenger operations to other UK airports at such short notice is also not realistic,"" the airline said. ""Ensuring ground readiness to handle and turnaround a widebody long-haul aircraft with 500 passengers onboard is not as simple as finding a parking spot at a mall."" Heathrow said it had ""tried to be as supportive as possible to airlines"", saying its cap on passengers was higher than the 64,000 limit at Schiphol in Amsterdam. ""It would be disappointing if instead of working together, any airline would want to put profit ahead of a safe and reliable passenger journey,"" it said in response to Emirates' criticism. The airport said a problem causing disruption was a lack of airline ground handling teams which it claimed was ""only resourced up to 70% capacity to serve passenger demand which has returned to 80-85% of pre-pandemic levels"". ""There are not enough resources across teams. Until that gap is closed, we need to take some form of action to give people a better, more reliable experience and keep people safe,"" it added. The Business Travel Association said the cap was an ""outrage"", and was a betrayal of all UK travellers. British Airways said Heathrow's demand was ""incredibly disappointing"" for customers and came after it had already reduced its summer schedule.

The 18 per cent rise in profit, based on strong customer demand, slimmed to US$5.6 billion after the UAEâs recently introduced corporate tax, which was applied for a full financial year for the first time. âThe Emirates Group has raised the bar to set new records for profit, revenue and cash assets,â chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in a statement. Emirates airline, excluding the groupâs other businesses, posted a record US$5.8 billion pre-tax profit, up 20 per cent from the year before. The group invested US$3.8 billion in new aircraft, infrastructure and technology âto support its growth plansâ, the statement said. Its workforce grew by 9 per cent to an unprecedented 121,223 employees. SEE ALSO State-owned Emirates Group operates the worldâs largest long-haul carrier.

Profit after tax fell to 9.3 billion dirhams (S$3.36 billion), from 10.1 billion dirhams year-on-year, the Dubai-based company said in a statement on Thursday (Nov 7). Revenue rose 5 per cent to 70.8 billion dirhams. âWe expect customer demand to remain strong for the rest of 2024-25, and we look forward to increasing our capacity,â chairman and chief executive officer Sheikh Ahmed Saeed Al Maktoum said.Â The state-owned carrier has enjoyed huge passenger flows through its hub in Dubai, helping boost profit even as the airline industry grapples with geopolitical tensions. In order to accommodate its growth plans, Dubaiâs government is proceeding with a US$35 billion expansion of its second hub, Al Maktoum International Airport, which authorities say will eventually become home to Emiratesâ operations.Â The Gulf carrier has a large fleet of aircraft on order, mostly for the still-uncertified Boeing 777X model. The company has said the long delays in aircraft deliveries from the US planemaker as well as Airbus are disrupting its growth plans and costing it business.Â BLOOMBERG Share with us your feedback on

The order for more of the current-generation freighters emerged amid tensions between Emirates and Boeing over separate delays but pre-dated Boeingâs announcement on Friday that its future 777X jetliner series would slip by another year to 2026. In September, Boeing reported orders from unnamed buyers for 11 777F freighters, but did not supply details. The sources said part of the total included a fresh order for the 777F from Emirates. The airline and Boeing both declined comment.

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/05/08/emirates-posts-58-billion-in-record-annual-profit-on-bumper-travel-demand/,Emirates posts record $5.2 billion annual profit on bumper travel demand | The National,2025-05-08,"Dubai's Emirates airline has posted a 10.6 per cent increase to achieve record annual profits after tax as long-haul travel demand held strong despite geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. The airline recorded Dh19.06 billion ($5.2 billion) in post-tax profits for the financial year ended March 31, it said on Thursday. Revenue rose by 6 per cent to Dh127.9 billion ($34.9 billion) as it carried more passengers through its Dubai hub. Growth was driven by the sustained appetite for travel across markets, an upsurge in air cargo demand and lower fuel costs, the airline said in its annual report. The wider Emirates group, which includes global airport services company dnata, recorded post-tax profit of Dh20.4 billion, up 9.7 per cent annually, while revenue rose 6 per cent to Dh145.4 billion. This ""performance places the Emirates Group as the most profitable aviation group globally in the 2024-25 reporting period"", the company said. ""It is no accident that Dubai has produced hugely successful global aviation entities including Emirates and dnata,"" said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed , chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group. ""Dubai’s aviation sector has become an influential force on the global stage. ""We don’t cut corners, and we don’t take shortcuts that put our future at risk for short-term gains."" The Dubai airline carried more than 53.6 million passengers during the fiscal year, up 3.4 per cent from a year ago. Capacity, measured in available seat kilometres, increased by 3.9 per cent. Load factor, a measure of how well an airline fills available seats with paying passengers, reached 78.9 per cent, a marginal decline from 79.9 per cent in the previous fiscal year. Emirates also continued to expand its network, adding destinations Bogota and Madagascar and restarting flights to Phnom Penh, Lagos, Adelaide and Edinburgh. It is serving 148 cities in 80 countries, as of the end of March. The state-owned airline benefitted from major passenger flows through Dubai despite the aviation industry grappling with tensions in the Middle East and economic uncertainty arising from US President Donald Trump's trade policies. While the US tariffs announcement was made on April 2, after the airline's financial year ended, the lead up to it was paved with widespread speculation and uncertainty. Emirates had previously said it was used to coping with disruptions such as geopolitical instability, recessions, currency fluctuations and volatile fuel prices. “Emirates’ results reflect the inherent strength of the brand, the fruits of its labour in investing across its A380 and 777 fleet products as well as inducting new A350-900s that has allowed the airline to stretch its wings and route network,"" Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at StrategicAero Research, told The National . “In the near term, the impact of US tariffs is a valid concern. While Emirates doesn’t have any immediate deliveries that would hurt them, the reality is that the US government will likely look at those countries where there’s been significant Boeing buys and either exempt or reduce planned tariffs.” While Emirates awaits delivery of the much-delayed 777X, its first aircraft is due in around the third quarter of 2026, so there is ample time for the UAE and US to reach an agreement that minimises the impact, Mr Ahmad added. Dubai recorded a 3 per cent annual increase in international visitor numbers to 5.31 million in the first three months of the year, according to government data. The city attracted 18.7 million international tourists in 2024 , up 9 per cent annually. Dubai International Airport recorded a 1.5 per cent year-on-year increase in passenger traffic in the first quarter. The world's busiest international airport handled 23.4 million passengers in the first three months of the year, as it also continued to boost investments in infrastructure and technology. To accommodate the future growth in passengers, Dubai is building a $35 billion terminal at its second airport, Al Maktoum International, which will eventually become home to Emirates airline's operations. Emirates, which has a fleet mix of Boeing 777, Airbus A380 and Airbus A350 aircraft, has more than 300 aircraft on its orderbook - mainly Boeing 777X wide-bodies. The airline expects to receive the long-delayed jets in the second half of next year. It also expects to receive between 12 and 15 A350s by the end of this year. ""With ongoing delays in new aircraft deliveries, we added 99 more aircraft to our retrofit programme. Emirates will now put 219 aircraft through a full cabin refresh at a total investment of $5 billion,"" the airline said on Thursday. The airline also has an appetite for additional new jets, Sheikh Ahmed said last month. ""We're also thinking about the Dubai Airshow and maybe there will be some new announcement,"" he told reporters at the Arabian Travel Market, declining to specify the size of a potential plane order or the aircraft models. In tandem with new aircraft deliveries, Emirates this year raised Dh3.2 billion in aircraft financing through a mix of commercial term loans, export credit agency facilities and Japanese operating lease with call option structures. ""With a strong cash balance and operating cash flow, Emirates is in a strong position to finance our future fleet growth and has already secured offers to fund our aircraft deliveries in 2025-26,"" the airline said.        1.

increase to achieve record annual profits after tax as long haul travel demand held strong despite geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty the airline recorded dh19 06 billion 5 2 billion in post tax profits for the financial year ended march 31 it said on thursday revenue rose by 6 per cent to dh127 9 billion 34 9 billion as it carried more passengers through its dubai hub growth was driven by the sustained appetite for travel across markets an upsurge in air cargo demand and lower fuel costs the airline said in its annual report the wider emirates group which includes global airport services company dnata recorded post tax profit of dh20 4 billion up 9 7 per cent annually while revenue rose 6 per cent to dh145 4 billion this performance places the emirates group as the most profitable aviation group globally in the 2024 25 reporting period the company said it is no accident that dubai has produced hugely successful global aviation entities including emirates and dnata said sheikh ahmed bin saeed chairman and chief executive of emirates airline and group dubai ’ s aviation sector has become an influential force on the global stage we don ’ t cut corners and we don ’ t take shortcuts that put our future at risk for short term gains the dubai airline carried more than 53 6 million passengers during the fiscal year up 3 4 per cent from a year ago capacity measured in available seat kilometres increased by 3 9 per cent load factor a measure of how well an airline fills available seats with paying passengers reached 78 9 per cent a marginal decline from 79 9 per cent in the previous fiscal year emirates also continued to expand its network adding destinations bogota and madagascar and restarting flights to phnom penh lagos adelaide and edinburgh it is serving 148 cities in 80 countries as of the end of march the state owned airline benefitted from major passenger flows through dubai despite the aviation industry grappling with tensions in the middle east and economic uncertainty arising from us president donald trump s trade policies while the us tariffs announcement was made on april 2 after the airline s financial year ended the lead up to it was paved with widespread speculation and uncertainty emirates had previously said it was used to coping with disruptions such as geopolitical instability recessions currency fluctuations and volatile fuel prices “ emirates ’ results reflect the inherent strength of the brand the fruits of its labour in investing across its a380 and 777 fleet products as well as inducting new a350 900s that has allowed the airline to stretch its wings and route network saj ahmad chief analyst at strategicaero research told the national “ in the near term the impact of us tariffs is a valid concern while emirates doesn ’ t have any immediate deliveries that would hurt them the reality is that the us government will likely look at those countries where there ’ s been significant boeing buys and either exempt or reduce planned tariffs ” while emirates awaits delivery of the much delayed 777x its first aircraft is due in around the third quarter of 2026 so there is ample time for the uae and us to reach an agreement that minimises the impact mr ahmad added dubai recorded a 3 per cent annual increase in international visitor numbers to 5 31 million in the first three months of the year according to government data the city attracted 18 7 million international tourists in 2024 up 9 per cent annually dubai international airport recorded a 1 5 per cent year on year increase in passenger traffic in the first quarter the world s busiest international airport handled 23 4 million passengers in the first three months of the year as it also continued to boost investments in infrastructure and technology to accommodate the future growth in passengers dubai is building a 35 billion terminal at its second airport al maktoum international which will eventually become home to emirates airline s operations emirates which has a fleet mix of boeing 777 airbus a380 and airbus a350 aircraft has more than 300 aircraft on its orderbook mainly boeing 777x wide bodies the airline expects to receive the long delayed jets in the second half of next year it also expects to receive between 12 and 15 a350s by the end of this year with ongoing delays in new aircraft deliveries we added 99 more aircraft to our retrofit programme emirates will now put 219 aircraft through a full cabin refresh at a total investment of 5 billion the airline said on thursday the airline also has an appetite for additional new jets sheikh ahmed said last month we re also thinking about the dubai airshow and maybe there will be some new announcement he told reporters at the arabian travel market declining to specify the size of a potential plane order or the aircraft models in tandem with new aircraft deliveries emirates this year raised dh3 2 billion in aircraft financing through a mix of commercial term loans export credit agency facilities and japanese operating lease with call option structures with a strong cash balance and operating cash flow emirates is in a strong position to finance our future fleet growth and has already secured offers to fund our aircraft deliveries in 2025 26 the airline said 1 fasting 2 prayer 3 hajj 4 shahada 5 zakat we are betting on you you are the

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/04/29/atm-2025-emirates-expects-record-annual-results-and-is-ipo-ready-sheikh-ahmed-says/,"ATM 2025: Emirates expects record annual results and is IPO-ready, Sheikh Ahmed says  | The National",2025-04-29,"Emirates expects a ""record"" annual financial result, said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed , chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group, adding that if the Dubai government asked the company to list, then he would proceed with it. ""We are very satisfied when it comes to our cash reserves on the airline side,"" he said at a press conference on Monday on the sidelines of the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai. ""If they [the Dubai government] say do it [an initial public offering] tomorrow, I have to do it."" The airline, which is retrofitting about 90 per cent of its total fleet and has more than 300 aircraft on its orderbook, has an appetite for additional new jets and hinted at a possible plane order at the Dubai Airshow in November. ""We're also thinking about the Dubai Airshow and maybe there will be some new announcement,"" Sheikh Ahmed said, declining to specify the size of a potential plane order or the aircraft models. Emirates airline president Tim Clark in March told Bloomberg TV that the carrier is “in the market” for more Airbus A350s and Boeing 777Xs. Asked if the larger A350-1000 model is an option for a possible order, despite issues that Emirates has with the performance of the Rolls Royce engines powering the plane, Sheikh Ahmed said: ""We look at it, but no decision has been made."" He said Emirates expects to receive deliveries of its long-delayed Boeing 777X aircraft in the second half of 2026, and is scheduled to get 12 to 15 Airbus A350-900s this year. Emirates will spend about $5 billion to retrofit its older Boeing 777 and discontinued Airbus A380s to keep older aircraft flying for longer, amid delays in deliveries of new models. While airlines receive compensation from plane makers for delayed aircraft deliveries, it does not match the revenue earned from receiving and flying those jets, Sheikh Ahmed said. Compensation ""is not to the extent that I want to see the aircraft flying. I will be able to make more money than the compensation. That's it"", he said. Emirates was supposed to get 90 Boeing 777Xs today if the aircraft debuted on time. Asked if Emirates would be ready to buy Boeing aircraft destined for Chinese airlines if they are not delivered due to the escalating US-China trade war, Sheikh Ahmed said: ""Maybe yes, but also it's not as simple as that."" An aircraft destined for a Chinese airline will be fitted out in that carrier's cabin interiors, seats and design. However, Emirates would not simply load passengers on an aircraft that is not up to its own standards and specs. ""If you think about those aircraft, they were going to China, so we expect that they will be in whatever airline's fit-out, seats, looks, you name it,"" he said. ""But for me, if I will operate any aircraft as Emirates, it's got to be Emirates-themed."" The additional cost for stripping out the aircraft interiors and retrofitting them would be more expensive. ""I'm sure that Boeing will not sell it at half the price ... Taking this aircraft, stripping this aircraft, retrofitting, it will be a bit expensive to deal with that."" Emirates does not see an impact on its business from US President Donald Trump's imposed tariffs regime. ""It's a bit early for me to pre-judge as we speak today but I always remain very optimistic in terms of seeing any issue that we can deal with that will really affect the business. Businesses are used to seeing an increase in costs,"" Sheikh Ahmed said. ""We are doing very well in terms of traffic and seat factor, on every point on the whole network ... I didn’t see any shift in terms of decline in the number of people traveling to the US."" The airline chairman said he remains ""very optimistic"" that 2025 will be another good year. Dubai has awarded contracts for its $35 billion new terminal at Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC), marking progress in the mega-project, according to Sheikh Ahmed. Work has started on the airport since Dubai's ruler gave the go-ahead on the project a year ago, he said. Emirates is expected to move its operations to the new passenger terminal at Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) within the decade. ""When we talk about an airport of that size, we have to think how complex it can be,"" he said. Stakeholders including home carriers Emirates, Flydubai, Dubai Airports, Dnata and others are engaged in preparing a plan to ""make it perfect at the day of the opening"", he said. This will require an extensive Operational Readiness and Airport Transfer (ORAT) programme ahead of the opening. ""Just because of the size (of the airport), just on the training side on opening for that day, maybe we need about 12 months,” he said, adding that the existing airport terminals in Dubai took about three to four months of preparations for opening day.

that they will be in whatever airline s fit out seats looks you name it he said but for me if i will operate any aircraft as emirates it s got to be emirates themed the additional cost for stripping

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/05/08/emirates-airline-bonus-salaries/,Emirates to offer 22-week bonus to employees after record profit  | The National,2025-05-08,"Dubai airline Emirates will pay a 22-week bonus to eligible employees after posting a record profit for the past financial year, The National understands. It was the third consecutive year of record profits for the airline, which has benefitted from rising travel demand and lower fuel costs. Emirates posted a post-tax profit on Thursday of Dh19.06 billion ($5.2 billion) for the year ended in March, an annual increase of 10.6 per cent, as long-haul travel demand stayed strong despite geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Revenue rose by 6 per cent to Dh127.9 billion as the airline carried more than 53.6 million passengers during the fiscal year. This is also the third year in a row that Emirates has announced hefty bonuses for its staff . Eligible employees received a 20-week bonus last year , and more than 50,000 staff received 24 weeks' pay with their May 2023 salaries. The airline has also been increasing its workforce. It recorded a 9.5 per cent year-on-year rise to reach 69,465 employees in the last fiscal year, it said on Thursday. ""Since Emirates was established, we’ve returned a profit every year except in 1986-87, and during the Covid-19 pandemic from 2020-21 to 2021-22,"" said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed , chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group. For 2024-25, Emirates and dnata announced combined dividends of Dh6 billion for its owner, the Investment Corporation of Dubai. Last month, Sheikh Ahmed said that if the Dubai government asked the company to list, then he would proceed with it. ""We are very satisfied when it comes to our cash reserves on the airline side,"" he said at a press conference on the sidelines of the Arabian Travel Market in Dubai. ""If they [the Dubai government] say do it [an initial public offering] tomorrow, I have to do it."" The airline, which is retrofitting about 90 per cent of its fleet and has more than 300 aircraft on order, hinted at further plane acquisitions at the Dubai Airshow in November.

Unlike traditional databases, DLTs have no central administrator or centralised data storage. They are transparent because the data is visible and, because they are automatically replicated and impossible to be tampered with, they are secure. The main difference between blockchain and other forms of DLT is the way data is stored as ‘blocks’ – new transactions are added to the existing ‘chain’ of past transactions, hence the name ‘blockchain’. It is impossible to delete or modify information on the chain due to the replication of blocks across various locations. Blockchain is mostly associated with cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Due to the inability to tamper with transactions, advocates say this makes the currency more secure and safer than traditional systems. It is maintained by a network of people referred to as ‘miners’, who receive rewards for solving complex mathematical equations that enable transactions to go through. However, one of the major problems that has come to light has been the presence of illicit material buried in the Bitcoin blockchain, linking it to the dark web. Other blockchain platforms can offer things like smart contracts, which are automatically implemented when specific conditions from all interested parties are reached, cutting the time involved and the risk of mistakes. Another use could be storing medical records, as patients can be confident their information cannot be changed. The technology can also be used in supply chains, voting and has the potential to used for storing property records. • Remittance charges will be tackled by blockchain • UAE's monumental and risky Mars Mission to inspire future generations, says minister • Could the UAE drive India's economy? • News has a bright future and the UAE is at the heart of it • Architecture is over - here's cybertecture • The National announces Future of News journalism competition • Round up: Experts share their visions of the world to come Exclusive: Transgender Emiratis fight for recognition after reassignment surgery abroad 'The person in the mirror was not me': Emirati tells of gender struggle from childhood to adulthood A second lockdown will be especially tough in cold countries Hard-hit Canada is springing back to the cliched 'new normal' Justin Trudeau 2.0 will need to take all of Canada with him Falcon demand driving region's bird smuggling trade UAE ranks high for animal trafficking as smugglers target Dubai International Airport, report finds Innotech Profile Date started: 2013 Founder/CEO: Othman Al Mandhari Based: Muscat, Oman Sector: Additive manufacturing, 3D printing technologies Size: 15 full-time employees Stage: Seed stage and seeking Series A round of financing Investors: Oman Technology Fund from 2017 to 2019, exited through an agreement with a new investor to secure new funding that it under negotiation right now.

Introduced in 2011 by Uefa, European football’s governing body, it demands that clubs live within their means. Chiefly, spend within their income and not make substantial losses. What the rules dictate? The second phase of its implementation limits losses to €30 million (Dh136m) over three seasons. Extra expenditure is permitted for investment in sustainable areas (youth academies, stadium development, etc). Money provided by owners is not viewed as income. Revenue from “related parties” to those owners is assessed by Uefa's “financial control body” to be sure it is a fair value, or in line with market prices. What are the penalties? There are a number of punishments, including fines, a loss of prize money or having to reduce squad size for European competition – as happened to PSG in 2014. There is even the threat of a competition ban, which could in theory lead to PSG’s suspension from the Uefa Champions League.

data is recorded across multiple places at the same time unlike traditional databases dlts have no central administrator or centralised data storage they are transparent because the data is visible and because they are automatically replicated and impossible to be tampered with they are secure the main difference between blockchain and other forms of dlt is the way data is stored as ‘blocks’ – new transactions are added to the existing ‘chain’ of past transactions hence the name ‘blockchain’ it is impossible to delete or modify information on the chain due to the replication of blocks across various locations blockchain is mostly associated with cryptocurrency bitcoin due to the inability to tamper with transactions advocates say this makes the currency more secure and safer than traditional systems it is maintained by a network of people referred to as ‘miners’ who receive rewards for solving complex mathematical equations that enable transactions to go through however one of the major problems that has come to light has been the presence of illicit material buried in the bitcoin blockchain linking it to the dark web other blockchain platforms can offer things like smart contracts which are automatically implemented when specific conditions from all interested parties are reached cutting the time involved and the risk of mistakes another use could be storing medical records as patients can be confident their information cannot be changed the technology can also be used in supply chains voting and has the potential to used for storing property records • remittance

https://www.thenationalnews.com/travel/2025/07/01/emirates-shenzhen-china-flights/,Emirates launches inaugural flight to China’s tech hub Shenzhen | The National,2025-07-01,"Emirates launched its inaugural flight to Shenzhen on Tuesday, marking the Dubai airline's entry into China ’s fourth-largest city. Senior delegation from Emirates, including Orhan Abbas, senior vice president for commercial operations in the Far East, was on board. Departing Dubai International’s Terminal 3 at 3.35am local time, flight EK328 arrived in Shenzhen’s Bao’an International Airport at 3.30pm, completing a seven-hour and 55-minute journey across the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, mainland South-East Asia and southern China. From Wednesday, the route will operate daily, departing Dubai at 10.05am and arriving in Shenzhen at 10pm. The return flight leaves Shenzhen at 11.55pm and lands in Dubai at 3.40am the following day. According to the airline, the schedule supports connections through Dubai to destinations across Africa, Europe and the Americas. Shenzhen is Emirates’s fourth destination in mainland China, joining Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. It is also the first Chinese destination to be served by the airline’s retrofitted Boeing 777-300ER. It has a capacity of 332 passengers, along with private suites in first class, lie-flat seats in business, as well as premium economy and economy cabins. For Shadi Al Refai, one of the passengers on the inaugural flight, the direct link to Shenzhen is a major timesaver. As the founder of Dubai’s Garage Studios, the Jordanian entrepreneur has travelled frequently to Shenzhen over the past three years to source everything from custom-made cables to cameras for his company. “Before, I had to fly into Hong Kong and then catch a train or boat to Shenzhen, which added at least three to four more hours,” he tells The National . “Now it’s more streamlined, and that’s great because it allows me to focus on what I need to do. At the same time, instead of spending that extra time travelling, I can use it to explore the city, which I’ve found to be really friendly and full of things to see.” The Emirates arrival adds to the busy operations at Bao’an International Airport, which handled more than 61.5 million travellers in 2024, according to Centre for Aviation, the industry intelligence firm. The airport currently has two runways, with a third nearing completion and expected to open later this year. Terminal 3 has been expanded to accommodate international flights to destinations such as Singapore , Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur . Bao’an International Airport also serves as a key gateway to China’s Greater Bay Area, which includes Hong Kong and Macau. The new route adds to Emirates’s passenger and cargo operations from China, with the airline stating its weekly cargo capacity from the mainland now totals 2,000 tonnes. Positioned as a growing technology hub – home to Huaqiangbei, one of the largest electronics markets in the world – and located within China’s Special Economic Zone, Shenzhen is expected to generate new cargo demand, particularly for the specialised handling and export of electronics and tech products. “Our expansion into Shenzhen opens new doors for business and economic exchange between this technological powerhouse and global markets,” said Adnan Kazim, Emirates's deputy president and chief commercial officer, as part of the March announcement of the route. “As we prepare to launch operations, we extend our gratitude to the Chinese authorities and airport partners for their ongoing support, and we are committed to ensuring this route’s success while fostering cultural bonds and unlocking future economic potential.”  US VP candidate Kamala Harris and the complexity of racial identity Beirut blasts: What do we do with the world's ammonium nitrate?

https://www.thenationalnews.com/travel/2025/06/02/emirates-flight-dubai-damascus/,Emirates to resume flights to Damascus from July 16 | The National,2025-07-02,"Dubai carrier Emirates airline will resume flights to Syrian capital Damascus this month. After initial plans to relaunch the route on July 1 were put on hold due to regional flight disruptions , the first flight is now planned for take off on July 16. Going forward, there will be three services per week, on Sunday, Monday and Wednesday. This number will increase to four flights from August 2, with Saturday added to the timetable. By October 26, Emirates will further expand services to fly to the historic city daily. Hope for Syrians on Dubai flight to Damascus but Israeli strikes cast shadow The route was ceased by the Dubai-based carrier in 2012, as civil war broke out in Syria. But since the fall of former Syrian president Bashar Assad's regime late last year, followed by the lifting of sanctions on Syria by US President Donald Trump during his visit to the Gulf, several airlines have begun to reopen the route. In May, Emirates's sister airline flydubai announced it would resume flights to Damascus after 12 years. Flydubai's Flight FZ 115 touched down at Damascus International Airport on Sunday, after taking off from Dubai International at 6.30am local time. “Emirates is pleased to restart operations to Damascus and support Syria’s road ahead by providing better choice and connectivity, essential economic links for inwards investment as well as opening new trade lanes and global market access for the country,"" said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, chairman and chief executive of the Emirates airline and group. ""Re-establishing air travel and connectivity is also good news for our customers who make up the expansive Syrian diaspora across the Americas, Europe and the GCC, who are eager to fly back home and reconnect to their roots, and leverage their knowledge, skills, expertise and resources in ongoing development efforts. ""We would like to thank the Syrian authorities for their support in strengthening connectivity between Dubai and Damascus, and look forward to boosting links to and from the country through our regularly scheduled operations.” The service will operate with a 302-seat Boeing 777-200LR, 38 of which will be business class seats. Taking off from Dubai International Airport at noon local time, the soon-to-be-daily route will arrive at Damascus International Airport at 2.10pm local time.

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/08/05/emirates-sees-first-class-rise-in-premium-flights-to-uk/,Emirates sees first-class rise in premium flights to UK | The National,2025-08-05,"Emirates airline has recorded a surge in premium bookings by visitors to the UK , which it claimed is “driving forward economic growth” in Britain. Bookings for first-class seats on flights from China and India during the first half of the year were up 27 per cent and 17 per cent respectively, compared with the same period in 2024, the airline said. For travel from Australia, the increase in business-class bookings was 10 per cent. Emirates said regional UK airports such as Glasgow and Newcastle are also expected to announce an increasing number of Chinese visitors, with inbound passenger numbers anticipated to rise by 18 per cent and 45 per cent respectively in the second half of 2025 compared with a year earlier. All Emirates journeys on these routes involve changing planes in Dubai. The airline recently signed a declaration of intent with VisitBritain to boost inbound tourism. Emirates UK divisional vice president Jabr Al Azeeby said: “The UK is one of the most important markets in Emirates' global network and the growth in bookings we’ve seen over the past year reflects that. “We’ve seen a noticeable increase in inbound arrivals from key destinations such as Australia, India and China, driving forward economic growth here in the UK. Our partnership with VisitBritain underscores our commitment to grow tourism for the UK from key strategic markets.” The British government is aiming to attract 50 million international visitors a year by 2030. An estimated 41.2 million inbound visits were made last year. VisitBritain chief executive Patricia Yates said: “Expanding airline routes and seat capacity into our regional gateways is crucial to our competitive tourism offer. “International visitors are forecast to spend more than £34 billion in the UK this year. Making it easier for visitors to explore our nations and regions boosts that spending across more of Britain, supporting jobs, businesses and driving growth for local economies.” Young Emiratis are real target of fake news, Mohammed bin Zayed Majlis hears Majlis 2018: Young Emiratis see entrepreneurship and innovation on the horizon 'Pursue what you love - not just a high salary', universities minister tells young Emiratis Engine: 51.5kW electric motor Range: 400km Power: 134bhp Torque: 175Nm Price: From Dh98,800 Available: Now Simon Rushton: War vet raises £12m for health workers  Clean water and solar homes: Zayed prize finalists present sustainability solutions Youth take centre stage for this year's Zayed Sustainability Prize • Remittance charges will be tackled by blockchain • UAE's monumental and risky Mars Mission to inspire future generations, says minister • Could the UAE drive India's economy? • News has a bright future and the UAE is at the heart of it • Architecture is over - here's cybertecture • The National announces Future of News journalism competition • Round up: Experts share their visions of the world to come National Editorial: Suleimani has been killed, now we must de-escalate Mina Al Oraibi: Air strike casts a long shadow over the decade ahead Matthew Levitt: Iran retains its ability to launch terror attacks Damien McElroy: A CEO tasked with spreading Iran's influence Hussein Ibish: Trump's order on solid constitutional ground Simon Waldman: Cautious Israel keeping a low profile Name: Zinah Madi Occupation: Co-founder of Dots and links Nationality: Syrian Family: Married, Mother of Tala, 18, Sharif, 14, Kareem, 2 Favourite Quote: “There is only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything.”  Name: Razan Nabulsi Occupation: Co-founder of Dots and Links Nationality: Jordanian Family: Married, Mother of Yahya, 3.5 Favourite Quote: A Chinese proverb that says: “Be not afraid of moving slowly, be afraid only of standing still.” National Editorial: Suleimani has been killed, now we must de-escalate Mina Al Oraibi: Air strike casts a long shadow over the decade ahead Jack Moore: Why the assassination is such a monumental gamble Matthew Levitt: Iran retains its ability to launch terror attacks Damien McElroy: A CEO tasked with spreading Iran's influence Hussein Ibish: Trump's order on solid constitutional ground Rashmee Roshan Lall: Sound of silence in South Asia Troubled adolescents and cancer patients in sharp focus Social media cause of unbearable pressure among young people, says parent Cycle of anti-depressants proves difficult to break Residents find insurance patchy when it comes to treatment Fifth ODI, at Headingley England 351/9 Pakistan 297 England win by 54 runs (win series 4-0) 1.

https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/emirates-san-francisco-us-visa-requirements-panic,Panic on Emirates A380 at San Francisco as revised US visa rumors circulate - AeroTime,2025-09-22,"An Emirates flight from San Francisco to Dubai, due to depart on Friday, September 19, 2025, was delayed by over three hours after panic erupted on board as the flight was preparing to depart. The flight, Emirates EK226, was being operated by an Airbus A380 with registration A6-EVP, which was due to depart at 17:05 local time. As passenger took their seats on the aircraft for the 15-hour flight to the Middle East, news broke of President Trump’s executive order requiring skilled workers to pay $100,000 to obtain an H-1B visa. The announcement caused widespread panic on the plane as numerous passengers decided to voluntarily get off the plane rather than risk having to pay the sizable amount to get back into the US on their return Many of the passengers traveling on EK226 were reported to be Indian nationals who reside in the US under the privileges of an H-1B visa, which is granted to skilled workers from overseas. 70% of H-1B visas are currently held by Indian nationals. As reported by PYOK , many tech giants like Microsoft had already warned H-1B visa holders to delay travel outside the US and urged those abroad to return as quickly as possible. Therefore, as rumors that the $100,000 fine would be imposed imminently spread around the aircraft, people began to cancel their travel plans and to swiftly disembark the aircraft. Once the unconfirmed details of the Trump administration’s new H-1B visa requirements started to circulate among those on board, chaos swept around the cabin. In the ensuing melee, large numbers of passengers began gathering their belongings and headed for the exits. Eventually, to try to calm the situation, the captain of flight EK226 made an announcement over the aircraft’s PA to address the panic – “Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. Under the current circumstances, obviously, they are unprecedented for us here at Emirates. We are aware that a number of passengers do not wish to travel with us. That is perfectly fine. All we ask is that if you wish to offload yourself, you do so…” Concerned passengers soon started leaving the plane unhindered by the airline or ground crew. However, the process of offloading large numbers of passengers along with their baggage (which was already in the hold by this point) took quite some time. In the end, the flight eventually pushed back from the gate at 20:45 local time, some three hours and 40 minutes late. With such a delayed departure, the remaining passengers on the flight were on board for more than eighteen and a half hours, although as a benefit, they had more space to enjoy the flight to the vast number of passengers who had offloaded themselves. President Trump says he has introduced the $100,000 visa requirement over concerns that companies have been abusing the non-immigrant worker rules to replace American employees with cheaper workers from abroad. This is especially applicable in the tech sector, the White House argues, with claims that some US businesses are deliberately laying off American employees to replace them with H-1B workers – often a cheaper and cost-effective solution. The area surrounding San Francisco is well known as the US’s most important tech hub, often referred to as Silicon Valley. Initially, it was reported that the $100,000 payment would not only be required for new applicants but also existing H-1B visa holders if they attempt to return to the US from abroad. There were even rumors that the $100,000 payment would be required to be paid annually. The White House has, however, dismissed both of these claims, asserting that the $100,000 fee only applies to new applicants on a one-time basis. Should this be the case, then the move almost certainly spells the end of the H-1B entry visa process as it currently stands. In the meantime, those passengers who chose to offload themselves from EK226 on September 19, 2025, will no doubt be trying to rebook their Emirates flights, now that the situation has been clarified.

https://www.thenationalnews.com/news/uae/2025/07/30/emirates-airline-suspends-social-media-advertising-as-online-scams-increase/,Emirates airline suspends social media advertising as online scams increase | The National,2025-07-30,"Emirates airline said on Wednesday it was suspending its social media advertising to protect customers from the growing nuisance of online scams. The Dubai-based operator said it took action in response to “fraudulent advertisements currently circulating across social media platforms” that purport to be from Emirates. The company warned of cybercriminals impersonating the official Emirates airline website by using branded visuals, unauthorised trademarks and links which closely resemble those belonging to the company. UAE launches 'advertiser permit' for social media users and influencers Such phishing scams are created to lure customers to buy tickets, share personal information or follow malicious links. Emirates said it was working with social media platforms to have such advertising removed. “To safeguard our customers and uphold brand integrity, Emirates has temporarily suspended all advertising on social media channels,” it said in a notice to customers. “We are collaborating with platform providers to swiftly identify and remove these fraudulent advertisements, often within minutes of their appearance. “Your safety is our highest priority. We strongly encourage you to remain alert and carefully verify any suspicious content.” In February, Emirates advised customers to be vigilant following a fake membership offer to enrol in a discounted subscription to fly first class . A phishing scam posing as an advert offering 10 first-class flights anywhere in the world for a $300 annual membership circulated across social media. “Emirates is aware of fraudulent ads circulating on social media platforms that direct users to websites impersonating our legitimate site,” said a representative. “We urge customers to stay cautious. All official Emirates communications are only shared through our verified channels.” Authorities are seeking to step up enforcement action against a wave of increasingly sophisticated scams, many of which use advanced technology such as artificial intelligence. Emirates' move comes shortly after some UAE banks said they would no longer issue one-time passwords for online financial transactions through SMS and email starting on Friday in an effort to tighten security measures. Instead of passwords or OTPs, customers will have to authenticate transactions within their mobile banking apps, which experts said was a step in the right direction in efforts to boost security of digital banking and customer protection. “SMS and email OTPs for online transactions will be phased out from July 25. Switch to ADIB mobile app for in-app authentication,” said an SMS received from Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, Abu Dhabi’s biggest Sharia-compliant lender . Citibank customers had also received an email notifying them of the change. “We are enhancing the way you approve your online card transactions to provide you with greater security. As part of this upgrade, SMS OTP is no longer supported,” the email said. The lender said the change will be rolled out in phases and asks customers to download the bank app and complete their registration. After registration, customers will receive in-app authorisation requests to approve online purchases. In May, the UAE's cybersecurity chief said the country faced about 200,000 attack attempts daily. Mohammed Al Kuwaiti, head of the UAE Cybersecurity Council , called for greater international collaboration and more awareness to confront the mounting risks posed by criminals online. The use of artificial intelligence was a double-edged sword in cybersecurity as it was being used both to defend against and perpetrate attacks, Dr Al Kuwaiti said at the World Police Summit at Dubai World Trade Centre.

A total of 111,084 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to June 2025, the highest number for any 12-month period since current records began in 2001. Asylum seekers and their families can be housed in temporary accommodation while their claim is assessed. The Home Office provides the accommodation, meaning asylum seekers cannot choose where they live. When there is not enough housing, the Home Office can move people to hotels or large sites like former military bases.

And though it seems to them that everything outside this reality is heaven, yet they do not want to go to that heaven. They stay, because they are afflicted with hope."" - Mahmoud Darwish, to attendees of the Palestine Festival of Literature, 2008 His life in brief: Born in a village near Galilee, he lived in exile for most of his life and started writing poetry after high school. He was arrested several times by Israel for what were deemed to be inciteful poems. Most of his work focused on the love and yearning for his homeland, and he was regarded the Palestinian poet of resistance. Over the course of his life, he published more than 30 poetry collections and books of prose, with his work translated into more than 20 languages. Many of his poems were set to music by Arab composers, most significantly Marcel Khalife. Darwish died on August 9, 2008 after undergoing heart surgery in the United States. He was later buried in Ramallah where a shrine was erected in his honour.

UAE-wide visa changes: Expats imagine life after work in the UAE Buyers should try to pay as much in cash as possible for a property, limiting the mortgage value to as little as they can afford. This means they not only pay less in interest but their monthly costs are also reduced. Ideally, the monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 20 per cent of the purchaser’s total household income, says Carol Glynn, founder of Conscious Finance Coaching. “If it’s a rental property, plan for the property to have periods when it does not have a tenant. Ensure you have enough cash set aside to pay the mortgage and other costs during these periods, ideally at least six months,” she says. Also, shop around for the best mortgage interest rate. Understand the terms and conditions, especially what happens after any introductory periods, Ms Glynn adds. Using a good mortgage broker is worth the investment to obtain the best rate available for a buyer’s needs and circumstances. A good mortgage broker will help the buyer understand the terms and conditions of the mortgage and make the purchasing process efficient and easier.

Specialists Expats with specialised talents, including doctors, specialists, scientists, inventors, and creative individuals working in the field of culture and art are eligible for a 10-year visa, given that they have a valid employment contract in one of these fields in the country. Outstanding students: A five-year visa will be granted to outstanding students who have a grade of 95 per cent or higher in a secondary school, or those who graduate with a GPA of 3.75 from a university.

Employment lawyer Meriel Schindler of Withers Worldwide shares her tips on achieving equal pay Do your homework Make sure that you are being offered a fair salary. There is lots of industry data available, and you can always talk to people who have come out of the organisation. Where I see people coming a cropper is where they haven’t done their homework. Don’t be afraid to negotiate It’s quite standard to negotiate if you think an offer is on the low side. The job is unlikely to be withdrawn if you ask for money, and if that did happen I’d question whether you want to work for an employer who is so hypersensitive. Know your worth Women tend to be a bit more reticent to talk about their achievements. In my experience they need to have more confidence in their own abilities – men will big up what they’ve done to get a pay rise, and to compete women need to turn up the volume. Work together If you suspect men in your organisation are being paid more, look your boss in the eye and say, “I want you to assure me that I’m paid equivalent to my peers”. If you’re not getting a straight answer, talk to your peer group and consider taking direct action to fix inequality. Fujairah is a crucial hub for fuel storage and is just outside the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping route linking Middle East oil producers to markets in Asia, Europe, North America and beyond. The strait is 33 km wide at its narrowest point, but the shipping lane is just three km wide in either direction. Almost a fifth of oil consumed across the world passes through the strait. Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the strait, a move that would risk inviting geopolitical and economic turmoil. Last month, Iran issued a new warning that it would block the strait, if it was prevented from using the waterway following a US decision to end exemptions from sanctions for major Iranian oil importers.",emirates airline said on wednesday it was suspending its social media advertising to protect customers from the growing nuisance of online scams the dubai based operator said it took

they can afford this means they not only pay less in interest but their monthly costs are also reduced ideally the monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 20 per cent of the purchaser’s total household income says carol glynn founder of conscious finance coaching “if it’s a rental property plan for the property to have periods when it does not have a tenant ensure you have enough cash set aside to pay the mortgage and other costs during these periods ideally at least six months ” she says also shop around for the best mortgage interest rate understand the terms and conditions

meriel schindler of withers worldwide shares her tips on achieving equal pay do your homework make sure that you are being offered a fair salary there is lots of industry data available and you can always talk to people who have come out of the organisation where i see people coming a cropper is where they haven’t done their homework don’t be afraid to negotiate it’s quite standard to negotiate if you think an offer is on the low side the job is unlikely to be withdrawn if you ask for money and if that did happen i’d question whether you want to work for an employer who is so hypersensitive know your worth women tend to be a bit more reticent to talk about their achievements in my experience they need to have more confidence in their own abilities – men will big up what they’ve done to get a pay rise and to compete women need to turn up the volume work together if you suspect men in your organisation are being paid more look your boss in the eye and say “i want you to assure me that i’m paid equivalent to my peers” if you’re not getting a straight answer talk to your peer group and consider taking direct action to fix inequality fujairah is a crucial hub for fuel storage and is

shares her tips on achieving equal pay do your homework make sure that you are being offered a fair salary there is lots of industry data available and you can always talk to people who have come out of the organisation where i see people coming a cropper is where they haven ’ t done their homework don ’ t be afraid to negotiate it ’ s quite standard to negotiate if you think an offer is on the low side the job is unlikely to be withdrawn if you ask for money and if that did happen i ’ d question whether you want to work for an employer who is so hypersensitive know your worth women tend to be a bit more reticent to talk about their achievements in my experience they need to have more confidence in their own abilities – men will big up what they ’ ve done to get a pay rise and to compete women need to turn up the volume work together if you suspect men in your organisation are being paid more look your boss in the eye and say “ i want you to assure me that i ’ m paid equivalent to my peers ” if you ’ re not getting a straight answer talk to your peer group and consider taking direct action to fix inequality fujairah is a crucial hub for fuel storage and is just outside the strait

https://aviationa2z.com/index.php/2025/09/25/emirates-cancels-777x-business-class-plan/,Emirates Cancels New $35 Million Boeing 777X Business Class Plan - Aviation A2Z,2025-09-25,"DUBAI- Emirates Airline (EK) has revealed it scrapped the original Boeing 777X business class seats at a cost of about €20–30 million, citing the long delays in the aircraft’s development. The Gulf carrier, based at Dubai International Airport (DXB), was originally set to take delivery of its first Boeing 777-9 in 2020. The airline now expects handovers to begin only in 2027, a seven-year delay that has forced a costly rethink of its cabin strategy. Emirates’ President Sir Tim Clark confirmed with Executive Traveller that the airline abandoned the first-generation business class product designed for the Boeing 777-9. In 2019, Clark personally toured the first test aircraft, which at the time was nearly ready but missing the signature “game-changer” first-class suites. Fast forward six years, and none of the 107 aircraft from the original 2013 contract have been delivered. The extended wait gave competitors ample time to roll out advanced business-class cabins on newer aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, as well as retrofit Boeing 777s. Airlines, including Air India (AI), American Airlines (AA) , British Airways (BA), Cathay Pacific (CX), Etihad Airways (EY), Japan Airlines (JL), Malaysia Airlines (MH), Singapore Airlines (SQ), and the new Riyadh Air (RX), have all moved ahead with competitive products. Faced with that reality, Emirates determined the original 777X seats would no longer be up to standard. The airline scrapped them entirely, despite the €20–30 million loss. Clark admitted it was a difficult decision, but one that technology trends made unavoidable. From seat design to in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi, passenger expectations had shifted too far. Emirates has since committed to a fresh design for its 777-9 business class. The product is expected to feature enclosed suite-style seating, complete with high partitions and sliding doors to offer privacy. Clark noted this concept builds on the airline’s earlier innovation with first class suites on its Airbus A340-500 fleet in the 1990s, which later inspired competitors to adopt similar designs in business class. The preference for privacy in premium cabins has only grown stronger. Clark acknowledged that without enclosed suites, passengers may view the airline as falling behind. Emirates intends to ensure its business class aligns with what today’s business and premium travelers now consider essential. While Emirates has already incurred millions in scrapping the first seat design, further changes could shift the financial burden to Boeing. Clark stated that if new design updates are necessary due to the extended delays, Boeing may have to pay for them. He emphasized that Emirates had been ready to introduce the original product in 2023, but continued setbacks disrupted those plans. Boeing’s seven-year delay has not only cost Emirates on the 777X program but also forced the airline into an expensive interim solution: upgrading its existing fleet. With no new 777-9 deliveries in sight, Emirates invested US$4.5 billion of its own funds to refurbish its current Boeing 777-300 and Airbus A380 aircraft . One major change was the removal of the outdated 2-3-2 business class layout on its 777s. Clark admitted this configuration “long since should have been abandoned.” The upgrades were necessary to protect Emirates’ brand reputation in the premium travel market. While other airlines introduced suite-style cabins, Emirates risked being perceived as lagging behind. The airline now considers its refreshed cabins a bridge until the delayed 777X finally joins the fleet in 2027. Stay tuned with us. Further, follow us on social media for the latest updates.

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/03/05/emirates-aircraft-retrofit-programme-cost-increases-to-5-billion/,Emirates' aircraft retrofit programme cost increases to $5 billion | The National,2025-03-05,"Emirates will spend about $5 billion on a programme to retrofit 220 of its Boeing 777 and Airbus A380s to keep older aircraft flying for longer, amid delays in deliveries of new models on order from the manufacturers. The airline had said last year that it was expanding its retrofit programme to 205 aircraft at a cost of $4 billion. “We’ve had to take control of our own destiny,” Emirates president Tim Clark said on the sidelines of the ITB trade fair in Berlin on Wednesday. “I could see the problems on the horizon, so we took the decision then, and thank God we did.” Emirates “certainly” will not receive delivery of Boeing’s 777X in 2025 as the latest model of the popular wide-body plane is still waiting final certification, Mr Clark said. The 777X is crucial to Emirates' future wide-body fleet. The world's largest long-haul airline has built its fleet on the Boeing 777 and Airbus A380s, but the 777X is long delayed and Airbus has ceased production of the A380. Aircraft delays have become a major concern across the industry, with Boeing's rival Airbus also falling behind in delivery schedules. As a result, airlines have to keep older aircraft in operation for longer, often retrofitting them at a significant cost. Emirates, which will be the host airline of the Dubai Airshow in November, is considering additional aircraft orders as it expands its global route network. The airline is “in the market” for Airbus A350s and Boeing 777Xs, Mr Clark told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. “What happens at the airshow? Yes, we're looking at additional fleet, bearing in mind that we're looking now into the mid-2030s, simply because the manufacturers are not in a position really to offer many new aircraft to any client before the turn of this decade,” said Mr Clark. “So, you need to look at locking in positions for both Boeing and Airbus, given the ability to meet the current backlog … the Airshow will give us the opportunity, and probably the timing, to order some more aircraft.” Mr Clark also said that the global economy is in “uncharted territory” with regards to the impact from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. “One could see inflationary pressures coming in as a result. We can see that affecting discretionary incomes with regard to how they impact demand for air travel,” he said. “But this airline has been used to global traumas of some status over the last 15 to 20 years … so we will navigate our way through it. The demand for our services over the next six months or a year are very strong irrespective of this.” While the global economy is in a “fragile state”, the tariffs situation will “resolve itself”, Mr Clark added. “There will be over the next six months, or a year, a reset. The level of tariffs will possibly fall, depending on which countries enter into some kind of transactional agreement with the United States.” Emirates also expects to expand its operations further into Asia, Mr Clark said. Earlier this week, the airline announced plans to launch of daily non-stop flights between Dubai and Shenzhen in southern China from July 1. “We have got further access into China, we'll be pushing more in there beyond the point we just added starting in July, it's a great market, it's a very buoyant market, it's a well-sought after market. So, we will go there and continue to expand our operations,” he said. The airline this week also said it will introduce four weekly services to Da Nang in central Vietnam on June 2 and three weekly flights to Siem Reap in north-west Cambodia from June 3, with both cities connecting via Bangkok. “We are constrained by the availability of aircraft,” Mr Clark said, referring to delays in the 777X debut. “But as soon as we get these airplanes, we'll be moving into the Asian theatre more than we are perhaps today.” 'We are betting on you - you are the future', Gargash tells young Emiratis Young Emiratis are real target of fake news, Mohammed bin Zayed Majlis hears Majlis 2018: Young Emiratis see entrepreneurship and innovation on the horizon National Editorial: Suleimani has been killed, now we must de-escalate Mina Al Oraibi: Air strike casts a long shadow over the decade ahead Jack Moore: Why the assassination is such a monumental gamble Matthew Levitt: Iran retains its ability to launch terror attacks Damien McElroy: A CEO tasked with spreading Iran's influence Hussein Ibish: Trump's order on solid constitutional ground Rashmee Roshan Lall: Sound of silence in South Asia Dr Nawal Al-Hosany: Why more women should be on the frontlines of climate action Shelina Janmohamed: Why shouldn't a spouse be compensated fairly for housework?

on a programme to retrofit 220 of its boeing 777 and airbus a380s to keep older aircraft flying for longer amid delays in deliveries of new models on order from the manufacturers the airline had said last year that it was expanding its retrofit programme to 205 aircraft at a cost of 4 billion “ we ’ ve had to take control of our own destiny ” emirates president tim clark said on the sidelines of the itb trade fair in berlin on wednesday “ i could see the problems on the horizon so we took the decision then and thank god we did ” emirates “ certainly ” will not receive delivery of boeing ’ s 777x in 2025 as the latest model of the popular wide body plane is still waiting final certification mr clark said the 777x is crucial to emirates future wide body fleet the world s largest long haul airline has built its fleet on the boeing 777 and airbus a380s but the 777x is long delayed and airbus has ceased production of the a380 aircraft delays have become a major concern across the industry with boeing s rival airbus also falling behind in delivery schedules as a result airlines have to keep older aircraft in operation for longer often retrofitting them at a significant cost emirates which will be the host airline of the dubai airshow in november is considering additional aircraft orders as it expands its global route network the airline is “ in the market ” for airbus a350s and boeing 777xs mr clark told bloomberg tv on wednesday “ what happens at the airshow yes we re looking at additional fleet bearing in mind that we re looking now into the mid 2030s simply because the manufacturers are not in a position really to offer many new aircraft to any client before the turn of this decade ” said mr clark “ so you need to look at locking in positions for both boeing and airbus given the ability to meet the current backlog … the airshow will give us the opportunity and probably the timing to order some more aircraft ” mr clark also said that the global economy is in “ uncharted territory ” with regards to the impact from tariffs imposed by the trump administration “ one could see inflationary pressures coming in as a result we can see that affecting discretionary incomes with regard to how they impact demand for air travel ” he said “ but this airline has been used to global traumas of some status over the last 15 to 20 years … so we will navigate our way through it the demand for our services over the next six months or a year are very strong irrespective of this ” while the global economy is in a “ fragile state ” the tariffs situation will “ resolve itself ” mr clark added “ there will be over the next six months or a year a reset the level of tariffs will possibly fall depending on which countries enter into some kind of transactional agreement with the united states ” emirates also expects to expand its operations further into asia mr clark said earlier this week the airline announced plans to launch of daily non stop flights between dubai and shenzhen in southern china from july 1 “ we have got further access into china we ll be pushing more in there beyond the point we just added starting in july it s a great market it s a very buoyant market it s a well sought after market so we will go there and continue to expand our operations ” he said the airline this week also said it will introduce four weekly services to da nang in central vietnam on june 2 and three weekly flights to siem reap in north west cambodia from june 3 with both cities connecting via bangkok “ we are constrained by the availability of aircraft ” mr clark said referring to delays in the 777x debut “ but as soon as we get these airplanes we ll be moving into the asian theatre more than we are perhaps today ” we are betting on you you are the

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2025/04/24/emirates-bookings-trump-tariffs/,Emirates airline records 'solid' US travel bookings despite Trump tariffs | The National,2025-04-24,"Emirates airline recorded “solid” travel bookings between Dubai and the US in April as demand for flights remains unaffected by US President Donald Trump's tariffs , said the company's chief commercial officer. Adnan Kazim said it was too early to see an impact but so far, “we haven't seen a dip coming in”. “From the evidence that we have from the numbers, the way it's shaping up for us, we're not seeing an impact,” he said on Thursday before the Arabian Travel Market (ATM) next week. “Still, the growth pattern is looking quite positive.” The airline is used to coping with disruptions such as geopolitical instability, economic recessions, currency fluctuations and high fuel prices, so its annual financial results announcement in May will indicate that “you can always manoeuvre through these sort of uncertainties”, Mr Kazim said. “It is part of the DNA now of the business,” he said. “We've gone through many of these kind of turbulences in the past and we've come out of it even stronger.” Mr Trump's tariffs regime is spiralling into a trade war and poses the biggest uncertainty for the aviation industry since the pandemic. With little clarity on how travellers will behave in the face of a potentially deteriorating global economy and its impact on discretionary spending, airlines are struggling to accurately forecast their business. Issam Kazim, chief executive of Dubai Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, said the emirate was in a good position to weather economic shocks due to its tourism track record and geographic position. “I am confident that … Dubai is very well positioned to ride this wave. The diversified approach that we've created for the destination helps us in this,” Mr Kazim said. He acknowledged that some markets will be affected more than others, but that travel remained crucial for doing business. Travel patterns may also shift with people taking either short breaks or fewer holidays with longer stays, he added. “There will be that segment that we need to focus on within travelling parties and I am confident that we will be able to ride this wave in a positive way,” Mr Kazim said. Dubai recorded a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in international visitors during the first quarter of 2025, according to the emirate's tourism chief. “There are a lot of changes that are happening globally but with the diversified marketing approach that we have designed for ourselves, it gives us a chance to shift our focus as and when needed to make sure that the overall growth continues to be seen,” the tourism executive said. The Middle East travel and tourism centre is seeking to grow the number of tourists, length of stay, spending, contribution to GDP and repeat visits. “The length of stay has changed quite a bit: People are starting to see Dubai not just as a transit destination any more … but a destination where they want to spend a longer period of time. That works greatly for us,” he said. Emirates' forward bookings across its network of 150 destinations for May and into the summer are “really positive”, the airline executive said. “The outlook is trending even better than last year in terms of overall booking.” This indicates that economic uncertainties and currency fluctuations are unlikely to dampen a post-Covid surge in travel demand, with people continuing to spend money on travelling, he added. Asked if the US-China trade war may have an impact on the airline's business after expanding into Asia's biggest economy, Mr Kazim said that Dubai could benefit in terms of companies moving their operations to the emirate. Emirates also plans to launch more routes to China in the “near future” after recently announcing daily non-stop flights between Dubai and Shenzhen from July 1, he said. Emirates has so far received four Airbus A350s and expects to take delivery of another 12 to 15 of the wide-body model by the end of summer, the airline executive said. “With a capacity of 312 seats, it gives you flexibility in deployment, it can enter into many regional secondary markets which is what we're doing today,” he said. In March, Emirates said its summer schedule will include A350 services to Tunis, Amman, Istanbul, Dammam, Ho Chi Minh City, Baghdad and Oslo. A second tranche of A350s will arrive after the summer that will be used on ultra-long-haul routes , with destinations to be announced soon, he said. Emirates has already retrofitted 51 of its Boeing and Airbus wide-body planes, with plans to increase that to 87 jets by the end of 2025, according to Mr Kazim. The retrofitted aircraft currently fly to 36 destination, which will increase to 73 by the end of the calendar year. And as Emirates overhauls its aircraft interiors, it plans to increase the number of premium seats in its planes. The airline will add one million premium economy seats, to the one million it currently has, by the end of 2025, he said. This comes amid higher passenger demand from corporate travellers as companies are spending less on travel budgets after the pandemic, according to Emirates' Mr Kazim. “We're seeing more passengers moving from economy to premium economy, rather than cannibalising the business class,” he said.

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2024/11/07/emirates-group-posts-record-half-year-profit/,Emirates posts $2.4 billion first-half profit in UAE's first corporate tax year | The National,2024-11-07,"Emirates , the world's biggest long-haul airline, posted a first-half profit after tax of Dh8.7 billion ($2.4 billion) in the first financial year that the UAE corporate income tax is applied to the company. This is 7 per cent below the Dh9.4 billion post-tax profit the airline recorded during the first six months of its financial year from April to September. The figures for September 2024 and September 2023 are not directly comparable, given that it's the first fiscal year that the UAE corporate income tax of 9 per cent applies to Emirates' financial reporting, it said on Thursday. The Dubai-based airline's profit before tax reached a record of Dh9.7 billion in the April to September period, compared to Dh9.5 billion for the same time a year ago, reflecting strong travel and air cargo demand across its markets, Emirates said. The airline's revenue rose five per cent year-on-year to a record Dh62.2 billion. “We expect customer demand to remain strong for the rest of 2024-25, and we look forward to increasing our capacity to grow revenues as new aircraft join the Emirates fleet and new facilities come online at dnata,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed , chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group, said. “The outlook is positive, but we don’t intend to rest on our laurels. We will stay agile in deploying our capacity and resources in a dynamic marketplace.” Emirates recorded strong travel demand in the first six months of its fiscal year, despite the Israel-Gaza war. Like many other airlines, Emirates flights to Israel, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Iran have been impacted by the Gaza war and Israeli attacks on Lebanon. However, in the first half of the year, Emirates increased flights to eight cities: Amsterdam, Cebu, Clark, Luanda, Lyon, Madrid, Manila and Singapore. It also opened new routes to Bogota through Miami in June and Madagascar through Seychelles in September. Dubai International Airport, Emirates' home base, in the first six months of this year handled a record 44.9 million people, up 8 per cent on the same period of 2023. Emirates carried 26.9 million passengers between April and September, up 3 per cent from the same period last year. Capacity, measured in Available Seat Kilometres (ASKM), increased by 4 per cent. Load factor, a measure of how well an airline fills available seats with paying passengers, dipped to 80 per cent in the first half of the financial year from 81.5 per cent the previous year. The airline's direct operating costs, including fuel, rose by 6 per cent in line with increased operations, it said. Fuel remains the largest component of the operating cost, at 32 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the same period last year, it said. Emirates' freight arm, SkyCargo, carried nearly 1.2 million tonnes in the first six months, up 16 per cent compared on the same period last year, with “notable volume contributions from strong Chinese e-commerce traffic, and a rise in shipments bound for Dubai”, it said. Emirates group, which includes global airport services company Dnata, recorded post-tax profit of Dh 9.3 billion, after accounting for the 9 per cent tax charge, it said. The group's pre-tax profit rose one per cent year-on-year to a record Dh10.4 billion in the April to September period. Group revenue rose five per cent to a record Dh70.8 billion, reflecting “consistently strong” customer demand across business divisions and across regions it operates it, Emirates said. “This again illustrates the power of our proven business model working in combination with Dubai's growth trajectory as a city of choice to live, work, visit, connect through and do business in,” Sheikh Ahmed said. The group closed the six months with a cash position of Dh43.7 billion on September 30, down from Dh47.1 billion in March. “The group has been able to tap on its own strong cash reserves to support business needs, including payments for new freighter aircraft orders and other debt payments,” it said. The group also paid Dh2 billion in dividends to its Dubai government owner, as previously disclosed at the end of its 2023-2024 financial year. The group’s workforce grew 3 per cent year-on-year to 114,610 as of September 30. Dnata, the group's global airport services unit, recorded a 19 per cent drop in profit after tax of Dh571 million. Pre-tax profit declined 5 per cent to Dh720 million, mainly due to a one-off impairment charge of Dh152 million, the airline said.

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2024/10/15/emirates-to-receive-first-airbus-a350-in-early-november-following-delays/,Emirates to receive first Airbus A350 in early November following delays | The National,2024-10-15,"Emirates, the world's biggest long-haul airline, will take delivery of its first Airbus A350-900 in the first week of November, after it was pushed back from October due to delays . The plane will fly to Edinburgh as its first destination, the airline said. ""The aircraft is in the final stages of testing and things are going in the right direction,"" Adel Al Redha, Emirates' deputy president and chief operations officer, told The National on Tuesday on the sidelines of Aviation Future Week in Dubai, said. ""You always expect a few glitches with the first type of aircraft. So there's lots of co-ordination with the suppliers, lots of first-time connection of different systems."" Emirates is resuming flights to Edinburgh starting from November 4 using a Boeing 777 and will deploy the A350 on the route in December for the new aircraft's first entry into service, the airline said. ""When the aircraft comes, it's going to take over the continuation of Edinburgh [flights] and then later on when we receive more of the aircraft we will do more destinations in India and some more in the Gulf,"" Mr Al Redha said. The Airbus A350 jets are central to Emirates' long-term strategy. The airline aims to use them to serve ultra-long-haul destinations in the US, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand – each up to 15 hours of flying time from Dubai – after the initial launch of the wide-body jets on mainly regional routes. Emirates has 65 Airbus A350-900 planes on order, the first deliveries of which were supposed to be made in August this year but were first delayed until October and are now expected next month. Airbus deliveries fell 9 per cent in September to 50 jets compared with the same month in 2023, as suppliers struggle to meet demand. ""We are working very hard on it ... and it's going to be a very fantastic moment,"" Wouter Van Wersch, Airbus' executive vice president of international, told The National on the sidelines of the event. ""We are all looking forward to this. For Emirates, they are very used to the A380 but they will see the A350 is an amazing aircraft and I'm sure that it will enable them to do a lot of great things. We're very excited about this."" Emirates was also interested in the larger variant of the plane, the A350-1000, but airline president Tim Clark expressed concerns about the durability and longevity of its Rolls-Royce engines. The UK engineering giant has defended its Trent XWB-97 engines and said it is taking steps to improve durability and boost their performance. Asked about Emirates' assessment of the A350-1000 with the work Rolls-Royce is undertaking on the engines, Mr Al Redha said: ""We are close to the development but none of us are ready yet at this stage to commit because the outcome of the development hasn't been seen yet and it's effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated. There is nothing concrete in there to have both parties sign [a deal]."" Mr Van Wersch said Rolls-Royce had done ""tremendous work"" on the engine and are ""clearly conscious"" about what is needed. ""The engine has always been a little bit of a hot topic,"" he said. ""There is very good progress and we hope that Emirates will be convinced also to go for it. ""We've got many customers [globally] that have the A350-900 and that are now also moving to the A350-1000. That means the confidence is there and I hope we will give the right confidence also to Emirates and Sir Tim to make it happen shortly ... we think there's a logic to have both modules in the fleet, especially with a great and a big airline like Emirates."" Emirates is also expanding a programme to retrofit its Boeing 777 and Airbus A380s to a total of 205 aircraft at a cost of $4 billion, up from 191 at a cost of $3 billion, Mr Al Redha said. This comes as Boeing last week said it would delay the debut of its long-anticipated 777X aircraft until 2026, from an earlier delivery date in 2025. Emirates, a major buyer of the wide-body plane, on Monday said it would have a “serious conversation” about this with the US plane maker in the next two months. ""We have been predicting the delay and we have been introducing a different plan to extend the retrofit [programme] to more than the existing plan. The nature of the modification might change,"" he said, declining to reveal details. Emirates has completed the retrofitting of 31 aircraft in total so far, after work on the programme began in 2022. Airlines in the Middle East are grappling not only with supply chain problems, but also navigating their business through the two conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon where the war with Israel has intensified. The wars have prompted airlines to suspend some flights or to avoid affected air space. ""We have to identify alternate routes, which requires additional fuel because it takes longer,"" Mr Al Redha said. But the airline's costs have not risen significantly so far. ""It has not been a material impact [on earnings] because some of the flights we cancelled were only in the last two weeks,"" he said. The airline typically announces its first-half year results in November. ""The [financial] results will be pleasing because the revenue coming from passenger and cargo has been quite positive, so the results will be good,"" Mr Al Redha said. Travel demand has held ""strong"" across Emirates' network, with load factors ""in excess"" of 80 per cent this month, which is ""very good, considering it is non-travel season"", he added.

said rolls royce had done tremendous work on the engine and are clearly conscious about what is needed the engine has always been a little bit of a hot topic he said there is very good progress and we hope that emirates will be convinced also to go for it we ve got many customers globally that have the a350 900 and that are now also moving to the a350 1000 that means the confidence is there and i hope we will give the right confidence also to emirates and sir tim to make it happen shortly we think there s a logic to have both modules in the fleet especially with a great and a big airline like emirates emirates is also expanding a programme to retrofit its boeing 777 and airbus a380s to a total of 205 aircraft at a cost of 4 billion up from 191 at a cost of 3 billion mr al redha said this comes as boeing last week said it would delay the debut of its long anticipated 777x aircraft until 2026 from an earlier delivery date in 2025 emirates a major buyer of the wide body plane on monday said it would have a “ serious conversation ” about this with the us plane maker in the next two months we have been predicting the delay and we have been introducing a different plan to extend the retrofit programme to more than the existing plan the nature of the modification might change he said declining to reveal details emirates has completed the retrofitting of 31 aircraft in total so far after work on the programme began in 2022 airlines in the middle east are grappling not only with supply chain problems but also navigating their business through the two conflicts in gaza and lebanon where the war with israel has intensified the wars have prompted airlines to suspend some flights or to avoid affected air space we have to identify alternate routes which requires additional fuel because it takes longer mr al redha said but the airline s costs have not risen significantly so far it has not been a material impact on earnings because some of the flights we cancelled were only in the last two weeks he said the airline typically announces its first half year results in november the financial results will be pleasing because the revenue coming from passenger and cargo has been quite positive so the results will be good mr al redha said travel demand has held strong across emirates network with load factors in excess of 80 per cent this month which is very good considering it is non travel season he added total votes 1 8 million ashraf ghani 923 592 votes abdullah abdullah 720 841 votes dr nawal al hosany why more women should be on the frontlines of climate action

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2024/07/16/emirates-skycargo-orders-five-boeing-777-freighters-as-it-expands-capacity/,Emirates SkyCargo orders five Boeing 777 freighters as it expands capacity | The National,2024-07-16,"Emirates SkyCargo has placed an order for an additional five Boeing 777 freighters as it expands its fleet in line with the growth in the cargo sector. The additions will bring its freighter fleet to 17 and are expected to increase its main deck cargo capacity 30 per cent by 2026, the cargo unit of Dubai's Emirates airline said on Tuesday. The new purchase takes Emirates’ order book to 245 Boeing widebody airplanes, 10 of which are 777 freighters. It comes as a boost for the US plane maker, which has been grappling with safety and legal challenges, along with delayed deliveries. ""This investment in additional Boeing 777 capacity enables us to cater to customer demand and marks a step forward on our long-term strategic growth plan,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, chairman and chief executive of Emirates airline and group, said. “The next phase of our strategy will include a full assessment for our future freighter fleet reviewing all aircraft options to ensure we are best equipped to respond to the evolving demands of the market.” Emirates SkyCargo serves 140 destinations across six continents, with a fleet including 777 freighters, 777 converted freighters and 747 freighters. Its revenue for fiscal year 2023 reached Dh13.6 billion ($3.7 billion), contributing 11 per cent to Emirates' overall revenue, the company reported in May . Total cargo demand, measured in cargo tonne-kilometres, rose by 14.7 per cent annually in May, with the increase at 15.5 per cent for international operations, the International Air Transport Association said in a report this month. It marked the sixth consecutive month of double-digit year-on-year growth. ""The sector benefitted from trade growth, booming e-commerce and capacity constraints on maritime shipping,"" Iata's director general Willie Walsh said. ""The outlook remains largely positive with purchasing managers showing expectations for future growth. Some dampening, however, could come as the US imposes stricter conditions on e-commerce deliveries from China,"" he added. The global air cargo industry is projected to reach $210.3 billion by 2027, a nearly 11 per cent growth from an estimated $189.75 billion in 2024, data from Statista shows. Meanwhile, the order for Boeing comes as it is battling to overcome setbacks caused by safety and legal problems. This month , the company pleaded guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge, settling an investigation into two fatal 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia over five months in 2018 and 2019 that resulted in the deaths of 346 people. It is also being investigated after an Alaska Airlines 737 Max flight had to make an emergency landing, when an outer part of the plane fell off shortly after take-off, in January. “We deeply value Emirates’ trust in the Boeing widebody family and are committed to supporting their long-term strategic growth plan,"" said Stephanie Pope, president and chief executive of Boeing Commercial Aeroplanes. Boeing said it currently provides more than 90 per cent of the global ""dedicated freighter capacity"", including new production and converted airplanes.

Ramirez Tuskar Rock Press (pp. 310) Sir Tim Berners-Lee was born in London in a household of mathematicians and computer scientists. Both his mother, Mary Lee, and father, Conway, were early computer scientists who worked on the Ferranti 1 - the world's first commercially-available, general purpose digital computer. Sir Tim studied Physics at the University of Oxford and held a series of roles developing code and building software before moving to Switzerland to work for Cern, the European Particle Physics laboratory. He developed the worldwide web code as a side project in 1989 as a global information-sharing system. After releasing the first web code in 1991, Cern made it open and free for all to use. Sir Tim now campaigns for initiatives to make sure the web remains open and accessible to all.

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2024/06/03/emirates-boss-says-record-uae-rain-cost-airline-110-million/,Emirates boss says record UAE rain cost airline $110 million | The National,,"Emirates is reviewing its contingency processes after record-breaking rain that swamped the UAE in April cost the airline $110 million, the airline's president said on Sunday. “It was a very, very difficult situation to manage,” Tim Clark said during a media briefing at the 80th International Air Transport Association annual meeting in Dubai. “Our baggage systems became inundated with water, labels were falling off, containers all over the airfield – it was very difficult to get a handle on it. “It got so bad that access to the airport was underwater, so nobody could get to the airport.” Emirates boss wants troubled Boeing to foot its multibillion-dollar plane retrofit bill Airlines likely to tighten seatbelt rules after turbulence trouble, Emirates boss says For Emirates, it was “a Dh400 million cost” in that one incident, he added. “We measured that we had to do the right thing with our customers' claims and all other bits and pieces.” In April, Mr Clark apologised to passengers after days of disruption including flight cancellations and delays, with much of Dubai International Airport and the roads around it flooded. He said dozens of flights were diverted, while nearly 400 were cancelled and “many more” delayed, as operations “remained challenged by staffing and supply shortages”. Emirates' protocols were “under huge stress and challenges” and were overwhelmed by the situation, Mr Clark said on Sunday. “We've got to be far more aggressive, if you can call it that, and if necessary, stop the operations and deal with all the fallout,” he said. “That was always the last contingent … we never thought water would do that.” Now the airline is undertaking a major review of its procedures, Mr Clark said. “Next, we will go back to our major review going over all the processes to make sure we reshape our armour plate,” he said. “If it happens again, we're still going to face the same problem but, hopefully, we will be in a better place from the source, and that means we have to spend money on manpower, ground equipment and training.” Emirates has a “very big contingency response group” that deals with any scenarios that might happen and that is exercised three to four times a year. The airline is expected to move its operations to the new passenger terminal at Al Maktoum International Airport within a decade and the new base will take into account lessons learnt in terms of “maximising the evacuation of water”, Mr Clark said. Emirates airline president apologises to all passengers affected by storm 'It cost a lot. It was really tough': Sheikh Ahmed on how Emirates tackled UAE storm The new passenger terminal at DWC is expected to be completed by 2032 to 2034 and the plan is to move Emirates' massive operations from Dubai International Airport to its new home in one go. “It is likely that we will, as best as we can, do it overnight,” Mr Clark said. “It will be very, very rapid. The airport has been designed in a manner that it will be a mega hub. “Everything about it will improve everything that Emirates does, and the other carriers.” The new passenger terminal will be a “well oiled” and “easy-to-run” operation, which will make the transition easier, he added.

Evaluated through a comprehensive audit of quality of service, safety, and health control initiatives, Emirates is one of just eight airlines globally to achieve this accolade. Emirates also received a 2024 IFSA award for ‘Best Onboard Amenity,’ in recognition of Emirates Sustainable Economy Class amenity kit - filled with useful amenities to enhance passenger comfort whilst being composed of more sustainable materials designed for reusability. Recognising Emirates commitment to ensuring passengers ‘Fly Better,’ Emirates was awarded the World Class accolade for demonstrating the highest global standards of safety and well-being, sustainability, and service-guest experience. Celebrating a year of record profits , a successful first year of Premium Economy Class , sizeable investments into enhancing onboard services , and notable steps in the journey towards a more sustainable future , Emirates was lauded by the aviation industry for its innovation and commitment to excellence. APEX CEO Dr Joe Leader commented; ""Tonight, we did more than merely acknowledge the prowess and passion of the airline industry, we paid tribute to 2024 APEX World Class trailblazers like Emirates, who have unequivocally etched a golden chapter in the annals of air travel beyond five stars. I had the privilege of spending invaluable moments with President Sir Tim Clark at APEX's FTE EMEA event in Dublin earlier this year. The insights, the vision, the sheer audacity of Emirates' approach to revolutionizing the skies carried in every word he shared. Emirates is not just an airline; it's a symphony of innovation, ambition, and undying commitment to excellence."" About Emirates Economy Class Amenity Kits Emirates’ Economy Class range of amenity kits are complimentary for customers on long-haul flights, and feature designs that represent the four essential elements of nature – fire, water, earth, and air. The pouches are reusable and made from washable kraft paper with bespoke art printed in non-toxic soy-based ink. The contents include a selection of durable travel essentials made from materials that are more environmentally friendly than single use plastic. The toothbrush is made from a combination of wheat straw and plastic, and the socks and eyeshades are made from recycled plastic, in this case, rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate). To compliment the reusable amenity kits onboard, Emirates has several other initiatives in Economy Class which focus on using sustainable materials where possible, including cosy blankets made from recycled plastic bottles, where each blanket is made from 28 recycled plastic bottles – an initiative which has prevented over 95 million plastic bottles from going to landfill over the last 6 years. Single use plastic has been reduced with the introduction of wooden tea and coffee stirrers onboard, while paper straws and inflight retail bags are made using wood and paper from responsibly managed forests. For Emirates’ youngest customers, the airline’s complimentary toy bags, baby amenity kits and plush toys are also made from recycled plastic bottles and other sustainable materials. Emirates also recycles plastic and glass onboard when flights land in Dubai, diverting thousands of kilograms of glass and plastic away from landfill each year.

https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/emirates-group-reports-record-profit-2023-24,Emirates Group reports record profit for 2023-24 | Aviation Week Network,,"The Emirates Group has released its 2023-24 Annual Report, hitting new record profit, revenue, and cash balance levels. Both Emirates and dnata saw significant profit and revenue increases in 2023-24, as the Group expanded its operations around the world to meet strong customer demand for its high-quality products and services. For the financial year ended 31 March 2024, the Emirates Group posted a record profit of AED 18.7 billion (US$ 5.1 billion), up 71% compared with an AED 10.9 billion (US$ 3.0 billion) profit for last year. The Group’s revenue was AED 137.3 billion (US$ 37.4 billion), an increase of 15% over last year’s results. The Group’s cash balance was AED 47.1 billion (US$ 12.8 billion), the highest ever reported, up 11% from last year. Combined Group profits for the last 2 years, at AED 29.6 billion, surpass pandemic losses of AED 25.9 billion during 2020-2022. His Highness Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive, Emirates airline and Group said: “The Emirates Group has once again raised the bar to deliver a new record performance. Throughout the year, we saw high demand for air transport and travel related services around the world, and because we were able to move quickly to deliver what customers want, we achieved tremendous results. We are reaping the benefit of years of non-stop investments in our products and services, in building strong partnerships, and in the capabilities of our talented people. “Huge credit is also due to the UAE’s visionary leaders, especially HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. It is thanks to their leadership and the nation’s progressive policies that the Emirates Group is able to flourish. Both Emirates and dnata have forged successful business models leveraging Dubai’s unique advantages, in turn generating enormous value for Dubai and the communities they serve around the world.” HH Sheikh Ahmed added: “The Group’s excellent financial standing today places us in a strong position for future growth and success. It enables us to invest to deliver even better products, services, and more value to our customers and stakeholders.” Many major projects are already underway, including: a multibillion-dollar aircraft fleet and cabin renewal programme; new catering, cargo, and ground handling capabilities; advanced technologies to support the Group’s operations; expanded training and people development programmes; and initiatives to progress the Group’s sustainability agenda. In 2023-24, the Group collectively invested AED 8.8 billion (US$ 2.4 billion) in new aircraft, facilities, equipment, companies, and the latest technologies to support its growth plans. The Group’s total workforce grew by 10% to 112,406 employees, its largest size ever, as Emirates and dnata continued recruitment activity around the world to support its expanding operations and bolster its future capabilities. The Group took significant strides in its sustainability journey during 2023-24, putting into action numerous initiatives focussed on the environment, its people, customers, and communities. Environmental topics were high on the agenda during the year, as the UAE hosted the world’s biggest conference for climate action, COP28, in Dubai. In 2023-24, Emirates signed new supply agreements to uplift sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at its Dubai hub for the very first time, and also in Amsterdam and Singapore. The airline operated the first A380 demonstration flight using 100% SAF in one engine, collecting data to support industry efforts to enable a future of 100% SAF flying. Recognising that airlines today have the limited viable solutions to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions, Emirates established a US$ 200 million fund to support R&D projects that focus on reducing the impact of fossil fuels in commercial aviation. It also became a founding entity of Air-CRAFT, a UAE-based research consortium for renewable and advanced aviation fuels; and joined The Solent Cluster, a UK initiative focused on producing low-carbon fuels for a variety of sectors, including aviation. dnata continued to invest and induct more electric and hybrid vehicles to its global fleet of ground support equipment (GSE), adding new baggage tractors, cargo loaders, and pushback tractors to its USA operations. It also converted and refurbished diesel-powered GSEs in Italy to run on Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil and electric power. dnata’s UAE businesses including dnata logistics, Arabian Adventures, Alpha Flight Services and City Sightseeing Worldwide, transitioned to biofuel for its landside fleet of vehicles. During the year, dnata became the first combined air services provider to receive the International Air Transport Association’s environmental management (IEnvA) certification for its commitment to sustainability across its UAE businesses; and Emirates achieved IEnvA Stage One and the IEnvA Illegal Wildlife Trade module certifications, for its efforts in environmental stewardship and anti-wildlife trafficking. The Group ramped up investments in people development, rolling out a comprehensive programme of learning and training options for its workforce in partnership with top universities and key industry partners. A Gender Balance Council was established to champion and promote gender equality within the Group. The Emirates Group has expanded its ESG reporting in its latest 2023-24 report and are adopting aspects of the GRI standards. It plans to evolve its reporting to meet ISSB and CSRD requirements in the coming years. Sheikh Ahmed said: “We enter our 2024-25 financial year on strong foundations for continued growth. Emirates will receive delivery of 10 new A350 aircraft in 2024-25, adding to our fleet mix and supporting the next phase of its network growth. dnata will continue to leverage synergies and scale across its business divisions to grow its footprint and capabilities. In tandem, we are investing resources to minimise our environmental impact, develop our people, look after our customers and the communities we serve.” “The business outlook is positive, and we expect customer demand for air transport and travel to remain strong in the coming months. As always, we will keep a close watch on costs and external factors such as oil prices, currency fluctuations, and volatile environments caused by socio-political changes. Our business model has been tested before, and I am confident in our resilience and ability to respond quickly to opportunities and challenges.” He added: “Looking further ahead, the Dubai government has announced plans to start the next phase of expansion at Al Maktoum International Airport, which will eventually be the new hub for Emirates and dnata’s operations. This AED 128 billion (US$ 35 billion) investment will significantly expand and enhance Dubai’s aviation and logistics infrastructure, supporting the city’s growth, and Emirates’ and dnata’s growth.",the emirates group has released its 2023 24 annual report hitting new record profit revenue and cash balance levels both emirates and dnata saw significant profit and revenue increases in

https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/aviation/2023/11/09/emirates-airline-posts-record-first-half-profit-on-strong-travel-demand/,Emirates airline posts record first-half profit on strong travel demand | The National,2023-09-11,"Emirates , the world's largest long-haul airline, posted a record first-half profit in its current financial year as it ramped up capacity to meet strong international travel demand. The airline is optimistic about the next six months while monitoring headwinds, including higher fuel prices and geopolitics. Its profit stood at Dh9.4 billion ($2.6 billion) in the April to September period, up 135 per cent from the same period last year, on a boost in passenger numbers, Emirates said on Thursday. Revenue grew by 19 per cent, year on year, to Dh59.5 billion as the airline carried 26.1 million passengers in the first half, up 31 per cent from the same period last year. “We are seeing the fruition of our plans to return stronger and better from the dark days of the [Covid-19] pandemic,” said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed , chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airline and Group. “Across the group, we’ve continued to ramp up operations safely and move nimbly to meet customer demand. We’ve implemented a series of service and product enhancements to win customer preference, and we’ll continue to invest in our people, products, partnerships and technology to strengthen our capabilities and ensure we are future ready.” The record profit comes at a time when the airline is benefitting from robust demand for long-haul travel during the peak summer season. To meet this demand, the airline ramped up capacity in the first half of the financial year by resuming its Airbus A380 operations to Bali, Beijing, Birmingham, Casablanca, Nice, Shanghai and Taiwan. In July, it launched daily non-stop services to Montreal, a new destination, and its second destination in Canada. The number of the international visitors to Dubai exceeded the pre-pandemic level in the first half of this year as the emirate's hospitality and tourism sector posted a record performance. International visits to Dubai rose by 20 per cent on an annual basis during the first half of the year, the Dubai Media Office said in August. The state-owned airline increased its overall capacity during the first six months of the year by 25 per cent to 28.5 billion available tonne kilometres due to an expanded flight programme. Capacity measured in available seat kilometres increased by 30 per cent, year on year. The airline filled 81.5 per cent of its available seats in the first half of the financial year, up from passenger seat factor of 78.5 per cent during the same period last year. Overall direct operating costs, including fuel, rose by 9 per cent due to an increase in operations. Emirates renews long-standing bid for Berlin flights Emirates goes green with sustainable-fuel flight from Dubai Fuel accounted for 34 per cent of the airline’s operating costs but was slightly lower that the 38 per cent recorded in the same period last year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation grew 33 per cent to Dh19.5 billion. Emirates Group, which includes global airport services company Dnata, posted a record profit of Dh10.1 billion, up from Dh4.2 billion during the same period last year. Group-wide revenue rose by 20 per cent to Dh67.3 billion. The Emirates Group also grew its workforce to 108,996 as of September 30, up 6 per cent from March 31, and has continuing recruitment drives. “The group has surpassed previous records to report our best-ever half-year performance. Our profit for the first six months of 2023-2024 has nearly matched our record full year profit in 2022-2023,” Sheikh Ahmed said. The results highlight “the strength of our business model and [the] power of Dubai’s vision and policies that has enabled the creation of a strong, resilient and progressive aviation sector”, he added. Dnata's profit jumped threefold, year on year, to Dh709 million on the back of a 27 per cent increase in revenue to Dh9.3 billion as operations strengthened across its cargo, ground-handling, catering, retail and travel services units. The profit increase defied “lingering operational challenges” in many markets, such as a shortage of skilled workers, supply chain issues and inflationary pressures. Looking ahead, Emirates expects travel demand to remain strong and is monitoring headwinds facing the aviation industry. “For the second half of 2023 to 2024, we expect customer demand across our business divisions to remain healthy and we will stay agile in how we deploy our resources in this dynamic marketplace,” Sheikh Ahmed said. “At the same time, we are keeping a close watch on headwinds such as rising fuel prices, the strengthening US dollar, inflationary costs and geopolitics.” Emirates is among several global airlines that have temporarily suspended flights to Tel Aviv amid the Israel-Gaza war. Flights are currently suspended until the end of November. Global airlines are also facing mounting economic uncertainty amid the rise in cost of living that could pressure demand for air travel. 1.

While many have been quick to call a market collapse, this simply isn’t what we’re seeing on the ground. Many pockets of the global property market, including London and the UAE, continue to be compelling locations to invest in real estate. While an air of uncertainty remains, the outlook is far better than anyone could have predicted. However, it is still important to consider the wider threat posed by Covid-19 when buying bricks and mortar. Anything with outside space, gardens and private entrances is a must and these property features will see your investment keep its value should the pandemic drag on. In contrast, flats and particularly high-rise developments are falling in popularity and investors should avoid them at all costs. Attractive investment property can be hard to find amid strong demand and heightened buyer activity. When you do find one, be prepared to move hard and fast to secure it. If you have your finances in order, this shouldn’t be an issue. Lenders continue to lend and rates remain at an all-time low, so utilise this. There is no point in tying up cash when you can keep this liquidity to maximise other opportunities. Keep your head and, as always when investing, take the long-term view. External factors such as coronavirus or Brexit will present challenges in the short-term, but the long-term outlook remains strong. Finally, keep an eye on your currency. Whenever currency fluctuations favour foreign buyers, you can bet that demand will increase, as they act to secure what is essentially a discounted property.

The long-haul carrier Emirates announced Monday, May 13, 2024, it saw record profits of $4.7 billion in 2023 as the airline fully took flight after the turbulent years of the coronavirus pandemic disrupted its operations.(AP Photo/Jon Gambrell, File) DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The long-haul carrier Emirates announced Monday it saw record profits of $4.7 billion in 2023 as the airline fully took flight after the turbulent years of the coronavirus pandemic disrupted its operations. Emirates, owned by Dubai’s government, announced revenues of $33 billion, compared to $29.3 billion the year before. Profit the year prior had been $2.9 billion. The airline carried 51.9 million passengers in its 2023 financial year, as compared to 43.6 million the year prior. “Throughout the year, we saw high demand for air transport and travel related services around the world, and because we were able to move quickly to deliver what customers want, we achieved tremendous results,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and CEO of Emirates, said in a statement. “We are reaping the benefit of years of non-stop investments in our products and services, in building strong partnerships, and in the capabilities of our talented people.” Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, praised the airline, noting it “took off 39 years ago and the world of aviation is no longer what it was before.” “What is coming will be more beautiful, greater and better, God willing,” Sheikh Mohammed wrote on the social platform X. The Emirates’ results track with those for its base, Dubai International Airport . The world’s busiest airport for international travelers had 86.9 million passengers last year, surpassing numbers for 2019 just before the coronavirus pandemic grounded global aviation. The airport had 89.1 million passengers in 2018 — its busiest-ever year before the pandemic.  The airport now plans to move to the city-state’s second, sprawling airfield in its southern desert reaches in the next 10 years in a project worth nearly $35 billion . The overall Emirates Group, which includes travel company dnata, as well as food, beverage and leisure holdings, reported profits of $5.1 billion off revenues of $37.4 billion. The group declared a dividend to its owner, the sheikhdom’s sovereign wealth fund known as the Investment Corporation of Dubai, of $1 billion. It also gave its over 112,000 employees 20-weeks bonus pay, according to an internal email sent to staff seen by The Associated Press. The city-state, one of seven hereditarily ruled, autocratic sheikhdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates, provided Emirates some $4 billion in a bailout at the height of the pandemic . The annual report said Emirates had repaid $2.6 billion of that loan during the last financial year. In November, Emirates announced a $52 billion deal to purchase 90 Boeing 777 aircraft, 55 of them 777-9 variants and 35 of them 777-8s. Emirates will also add an additional five 787 Dreamliners to its previous order of 30 aircraft. For years, Emirates has relied on the Boeing 777 and the double-decker Airbus A380 to ferry passengers around the world. That will change in September, when Emirates says it will begin flying the Airbus A350 on routes. The airline has also embarked on a $2 billion retrofit program for its aircraft. But challenges remain for the carrier. Saudi Arabia plans to push into the market with Riyadh Air, a new carrier that made a jet deal valued around $37 billion with Boeing just last year with the flagship carrier Saudia. Climate change may be another concern as well — the wider UAE saw its heaviest recorded rainfall ever last month , which disrupted Emirates’ flights for days.     Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

https://aviationa2z.com/index.php/2025/09/25/emirates-cancels-777x-business-class-plan/      ,Emirates Cancels New $35 Million Boeing 777X Business Class Plan - Aviation A2Z,,"DUBAI- Emirates Airline (EK) has revealed it scrapped the original Boeing 777X business class seats at a cost of about €20–30 million, citing the long delays in the aircraft’s development. The Gulf carrier, based at Dubai International Airport (DXB), was originally set to take delivery of its first Boeing 777-9 in 2020. The airline now expects handovers to begin only in 2027, a seven-year delay that has forced a costly rethink of its cabin strategy. Emirates’ President Sir Tim Clark confirmed with Executive Traveller that the airline abandoned the first-generation business class product designed for the Boeing 777-9. In 2019, Clark personally toured the first test aircraft, which at the time was nearly ready but missing the signature “game-changer” first-class suites. Fast forward six years, and none of the 107 aircraft from the original 2013 contract have been delivered. The extended wait gave competitors ample time to roll out advanced business-class cabins on newer aircraft, such as the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, as well as retrofit Boeing 777s. Airlines, including Air India (AI), American Airlines (AA) , British Airways (BA), Cathay Pacific (CX), Etihad Airways (EY), Japan Airlines (JL), Malaysia Airlines (MH), Singapore Airlines (SQ), and the new Riyadh Air (RX), have all moved ahead with competitive products. Faced with that reality, Emirates determined the original 777X seats would no longer be up to standard. The airline scrapped them entirely, despite the €20–30 million loss. Clark admitted it was a difficult decision, but one that technology trends made unavoidable. From seat design to in-flight entertainment and Wi-Fi, passenger expectations had shifted too far. Emirates has since committed to a fresh design for its 777-9 business class. The product is expected to feature enclosed suite-style seating, complete with high partitions and sliding doors to offer privacy. Clark noted this concept builds on the airline’s earlier innovation with first class suites on its Airbus A340-500 fleet in the 1990s, which later inspired competitors to adopt similar designs in business class. The preference for privacy in premium cabins has only grown stronger. Clark acknowledged that without enclosed suites, passengers may view the airline as falling behind. Emirates intends to ensure its business class aligns with what today’s business and premium travelers now consider essential. While Emirates has already incurred millions in scrapping the first seat design, further changes could shift the financial burden to Boeing. Clark stated that if new design updates are necessary due to the extended delays, Boeing may have to pay for them. He emphasized that Emirates had been ready to introduce the original product in 2023, but continued setbacks disrupted those plans. Boeing’s seven-year delay has not only cost Emirates on the 777X program but also forced the airline into an expensive interim solution: upgrading its existing fleet. With no new 777-9 deliveries in sight, Emirates invested US$4.5 billion of its own funds to refurbish its current Boeing 777-300 and Airbus A380 aircraft . One major change was the removal of the outdated 2-3-2 business class layout on its 777s. Clark admitted this configuration “long since should have been abandoned.” The upgrades were necessary to protect Emirates’ brand reputation in the premium travel market. While other airlines introduced suite-style cabins, Emirates risked being perceived as lagging behind. The airline now considers its refreshed cabins a bridge until the delayed 777X finally joins the fleet in 2027. Stay tuned with us. Further, follow us on social media for the latest updates.

Bosses from the companies held talks on Friday morning about ways to avoid travel chaos over the coming months. Surging post-pandemic travel demand has seen airports struggling to cope, leading to delays and cancellations. In a joint statement, Emirates and Heathrow said they had come to an agreement. ""Emirates agreed the airline was ready and willing to work with the airport to remediate the situation over the next two weeks, to keep demand and capacity in balance and provide passengers with a smooth and reliable journey through Heathrow this summer,"" said Emirates Airlines President Sir Tim Clark and Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye. They said the move would assist Heathrow in its ""resource ramp-up"". The companies added: ""In the meantime, Emirates flights from Heathrow operate as scheduled and ticketed passengers may travel as booked."" Emirates originally rejected Heathrow's plea for airlines to make capacity cuts at short notice, with the carrier saying the airport's demand was ""unreasonable and unacceptable"". The airline had accused the airport of having a ""blatant disregard"" for customers after Heathrow capped passenger numbers at 100,000 per day during the summer, adding that the airport faced ""an 'airmageddon' situation due to their incompetence and non-action"". Another UAE-based airline, Etihad, told the Reuters news agency on Friday it would operate its five return daily Abu Dhabi-Heathrow flights at full capacity until the end of the month, despite Heathrow's request. Etihad added it was ""awaiting further information on the airport's longer-term plans for August"". Heathrow said it had no choice but to bring in a cap on departing travellers, which will be in place until 11 September. It said earlier this week that it was forced to impose cuts after it was unable to reach a compromise with airlines despite months of consultation. Before the pandemic, 125,000 people a day departed from the airport. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up and there are concerns travellers will be hit by further disruption and delays to journeys. Emirates said it was given 36 hours to cut departing passenger numbers, and therefore flights, and was threatened with legal action for not complying. Prior to Friday's agreement, the carrier said its ground handling and catering staff were capable of handling its scheduled flights, adding that the ""airport operator"" was responsible for issues ""with the central services and systems"". British Airways said Heathrow's demand was ""incredibly disappointing"" for customers and came after it had already reduced its summer schedule. BA is cutting an extra six flights a day in response to the move and says it has emailed some customers travelling on or before 25 July asking if they would like to change their flight or receive a voucher if they want to cancel. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for international travel has returned. Heathrow said it had ""tried to be as supportive as possible to airlines"", saying its cap on passengers was higher than the 64,000 limit at Schiphol in Amsterdam.",emirates airlines has agreed to cap

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62219559,Refuelling staff to stage three-day strike at Heathrow,,"Several airlines at Heathrow Airport could face disruption due to refuelling staff striking later this week. A total of 50 workers from Aviation Fuel Services (AFS) will stage a three-day walkout from 05:00 BST on Thursday to 04:59 on Sunday in a row over pay. Airlines affected include Virgin, United, KLM, and Air France. The strikes come as passengers have faced delays and cancellations in recent months, largely due to staff shortages in the aviation industry. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up and there are concerns travellers will be hit by further disruption and delays to journeys. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for international travel has returned. It has led to Heathrow Airport demanding airlines stop selling summer tickets and placing a cap on passenger numbers per day. Unite union said the industrial action would ""cause delays to hundreds of flights"", claiming AFS workers were responsible for refuelling half of the non-British Airways traffic at Heathrow. It is understood AFS is one of a number of refuelling companies which operate at Heathrow and that airlines affected are responsible for finding alternative suppliers for their flights. A spokesman for Heathrow Airport said it was in discussions with airlines ""on what contingency plans they can implement, including using other fuel suppliers already operating at the airport"". The BBC has contacted several of the airlines for comment. Virgin Atlantic spokesman said it had worked on ""several contingency measures, which can be deployed"" if the strikes go ahead. ""Our priority is to ensure that our customers can complete their travel plans, regardless of the proposed strikes, with minimal disruption,"" a spokesman said. Emirates told the BBC it would ""not be affected"" by the AFS strike. It is understood contingency measures include getting planes flying into Heathrow to carry additional fuel or having departing flights refuel at destinations. Using alternative fuel suppliers is another option. Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said AFS was ""wholly owned by incredibly wealthy energy companies who are entirely able to provide our members with a decent pay increase"". Unite said its members had not received a pay rise for three years, adding AFS had made an offer of a 10% increase which was ""rejected by members as it did not meet their expectations"". Prices are currently rising at the fastest pace for 40 years, prompting many unions and workers in the UK to ask for pay increases. Railway workers, train drivers, postal workers and check-in staff at Heathrow are among several groups to strike or vote in favour of industrial action in recent weeks. Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May and is forecast to go higher later this year. There are concerns that wage rises to cope with the current cost of living could fuel further inflation . AFS is a joint venture operation, which includes firms BP, Total Energies, Q8 Aviation and Valero Energy. A statement from AFS said the strikes would ""restrict our ability to refuel planes"" at Heathrow. The company said it had ""put on the table what we believed to be a fair and reasonable offer"". It said Unite had ""omitted"" a number of elements of the pay off which included bonus, overtime increases and backdating of pay. ""We know that our employees are concerned about the rising cost of living, as are many people employed in other sectors up and down the country,"" it added. ""We urge Unite to postpone industrial action to engage in further mediation. Nevertheless, we are continuing to work towards a resolution."" Unite regional officer Kevin Hall said the dispute over pay was ""entirely of AFS' own making"". ""It initially refused to enter into negotiations and only belatedly made an offer which workers judged entirely unacceptable,"" he said. But he added: ""Even at the eleventh hour strike action could be avoided if AFS made a substantially improved offer.""",several airlines at heathrow airport could face disruption due to refuelling

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68864207,Dubai airport: Full schedule resumes after flooding chaos,,"Dubai's major airlines say they have resumed a full flight schedule after torrential rain hit the United Arab Emirates and neighbouring countries causing chaos at Dubai airport. Emirates and flydubai said operations were back to normal on Saturday but a passenger backlog remained. The boss of Emirates said the airline's response was not perfect. The storm battered the UAE on Tuesday, causing flash floods and bringing travel through the airport to a halt. Priority will be given to passengers whose travel plans had been disrupted. A flooded taxiway meant planes were unable to reach the runway to take off and passengers were left stranded in the terminal building,at Dubai International Airport. The president of Emirates, Sir Tim Clark said: ""Passengers previously stranded in the airport transit area have been rebooked and are en route to their destinations."" The open letter posted on the airlines' website on Saturday, announced that regular flight schedules had been restored, but it would take them ""some days"" to clear the backlog of rebooked passengers. A taskforce has also been established to sort and deliver the around 30,000 pieces of luggage left behind. ""We ask for our customers' patience and understanding,"" Sir Tim said. Apologising to their customers, he acknowledged that their response was not ""perfect"", citing a lack of information and confusion in the terminals. Earlier this week, air passengers stuck at the airport told the BBC of the ""pure chaos"" they saw. Sarah Jane Cahill from Dublin, had planned to board her connecting flight from Sydney to Dublin on Thursday afternoon, but was still at the airport on Friday night. She said that ""thousands are stranded"" and that the airport was ""a sea of bodies on every surface"". ""There were people in chairs, couches, on the floor outside bathrooms, sleeping on cardboard,"" she told the Press Association. Over the past three days, the airline has cancelled nearly 400 flights and delayed many more. Some inbound flights resumed on Thursday, while outbound flights continued to be delayed. They later announced that check-in was open at Terminal 3 for Emirates and flydubai flights. Flydubai's travel update on Saturday said they had returned to operating its full flight schedule from Terminal 2 and 3, with priority over the next few days to be given to their ""passengers whose travel plans have been impacted."" Similarly, Emirates said their focus was on those who have faced travel disruptions. Sir Tim added they had suspended check-in for departing passengers, embargoed ticket sales and stopped connecting passengers from arriving to make sure the focus was on affected customers.

Abdullah Hussain, an aircraft enthusiast from Birmingham, said he saw the plane make ""quite a rough landing"". He said he believed ""a front tyre looked damaged and flat"". A source close to the airport said the Emirates aircraft had a problem with its brakes, but no one was hurt and there had not been a fire. The Airbus A380 is one of the world's largest passenger aircraft, carrying 615 people, and only recently returned to Birmingham Airport after not being seen there since before the pandemic. It serves a twice daily route between the city and Dubai. Mr Hussain said he had seen A380 land a number of times and ""normally glides really well"", so it was clear to him that this was ""not a normal sort of landing"". ""A whole bunch of then fire engines and other vehicles then came out"", he said. Emirates said the flight, from Dubai to Birmingham, made a safe landing and was then ""attended by emergency services and maintenance technicians as there were reports of smoke during taxiing"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61140802,Emirates will keep flying to Russia unless its owner stops it,,"Emirates' boss says the airline will keep flying to Russia unless its owner, the Dubai government, tells it not to. ""If we are told to stop we will stop, unless we are told otherwise, we will continue,"" Sir Tim Clarke told the BBC. Most major international airlines pulled out of Russia amid sweeping sanctions imposed by Western countries since the war began in Ukraine. But Emirates is one of the few carriers that is still operating flights to Moscow and St Petersburg. When asked if the airline would reconsider its position, Emirates president Sir Tim said that ""it was not his call"" but a decision that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government would take. As well as carrying passengers, the airline also transports cargo including humanitarian goods, food and medical supplies, which are not on the sanctions list. Sir Tim added that it was important to recognise the Russian population may not be part of the war in Ukraine. And that the diplomatic core of other countries, who have missions in Moscow need to be able to function by moving in and out of the country. He said: ""We are catering to people who are on the periphery of the main issue here, and that is probably the way the [UAE] government looks at it."" The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have rejected calls from western governments to impose sanctions on Russia. Abu Dhabi has also not severed economic ties with Moscow. It was one of only three countries, along with China and India, to abstain in a United Nations Security Council vote in February to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It also abstained in a General Assembly vote on 7 April to suspend Russia from the UN Human Rights Council. Since the outbreak of the war, Moscow has faced a barrage of unprecedented sanctions, including bans on Russian aircraft using airspace and airports in the US, the EU, the UK and Canada. International flights by Russian airlines have been severely curtailed due to the sanctions. National carrier Aeroflot has suspended all international flights, except for its service to the Belarus capital Minsk, due to the sanctions. Sir Tim believes that the war in Ukraine could spell long term implications for the global airline industry, especially if Russia is excluded by the West from the global economy. ""This [war] will have major manifestations of perhaps disadvantage for both sides. And this will have an impact on the industry,"" he said. Sir Tim said Emirates was seeing strong demand despite high oil prices. The airline has passed on the cost to consumers by adding a fuel surcharge to airfares but that hasn't impacted bookings. ""Irrespective of that, people are ready to pay the prices that we have to charge to cover this enormous increase in the fuel price,"" Sir Tim said. He added that the airline industry was used to dealing with high oil prices but said he felt that budget carriers would find it difficult get through this without taking a financial hit. Brent, one of the main benchmarks for oil, has been trading above $100 for nearly two months since the Russia-Ukraine war triggered volatility in global energy markets. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that the airline industry's overall financial performance in 2022 is likely to worsen due to the challenge of higher oil prices. Jet fuel makes up about a quarter of an airline's costs. Despite the recent setbacks, Sir Tim said that Emirates had returned to profitability over the last six months due to ""roaring"" demand. The carrier expects to report improved annual earnings this year after it posted a loss of $5.5bn in the 2020-2021 fiscal year as the Covid-19 pandemic ravaged the global aviation industry. The Dubai government injected $3.1bn into Emirates to bail out the state-owned airline, which was forced to ground flights and lay-off thousands of employees after the outbreak of the pandemic. Sir Tim said the airline was now looking to hire 3,000 to 4,000 cabin crew and additional pilots on the back of booming travel demand. ""If we can have all our aircraft flying today, 270 of them then we would. I can't because I am just short of crew,"" he said.",emirates boss says the airline will keep flying to russia unless its owner the dubai government tells it not to if we are told to stop we will stop

https://www.thenationalnews.com/travel/2025/09/30/emirates-power-bank-rules/,Emirates power bank rule on flights comes into effect tomorrow | The National,2025-01-10,"Using any kind of power bank onboard an Emirates flight is now is prohibited, starting tomorrow. The new rules mean each passenger will be allowed to bring only one power bank on board, but will no longer be permitted to use it at any point during the flight. The updated regulations include: The UAE flight routes launched and coming soon in 2025 Emirates says it is making this change to reduce the risk of incidents involving power banks on its flights. As more travellers carry the devices, there has been a rise in battery-related issues across the aviation industry. Power banks usually contain lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries, which are used to charge phones and other devices. These batteries work by moving tiny particles called lithium ions between two parts inside the battery. However, if the battery is damaged or overcharged, it can overheat, a process called thermal runaway. This can cause the battery to catch fire, explode or release harmful gases. While many modern devices have built-in safety features to prevent overcharging, this is not true for all power banks, particularly the cheaper or basic models. This is why they must be stored in an accessible location in the cabin – were anything to go wrong, the cabin crew can act quickly. The airline adds that safety is its top priority and these changes are part of an ongoing effort to protect passengers and crew. The policy follows in the footsteps of several other major airlines. Since the start of the year, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Korean Air and China Airlines announced that passengers will not be allowed to use or charge their power banks during flights. The UAE's national carrier allows passengers to carry power banks in carry-on luggage, purses or pockets. Each person is allowed to carry a maximum of 10 loose or spare batteries, including power banks. For electronic devices or spare batteries, the output of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries must not exceed 100 watt-hours; and the metal content in lithium-metal batteries must not exceed 2 grams. However, the use of power banks on Etihad aircraft is strictly prohibited. This includes charging the power bank onboard or using it to charge a device. The airline allows power banks and batteries but they must be stored in hand luggage. Only batteries with less than 160Wh can be carried. For batteries up to 100Wh or 2g of lithium (such as those in phones, laptops and cameras), up to 15 devices are allowed per passenger across both hand and checked-in baggage (if the battery is in equipment). Power banks or spare batteries not installed in equipment must be carried in hand baggage only, and must be protected from damage and short-circuiting. Charging or using the power banks is strictly prohibited onboard. The Sharjah-based carrier allows power banks on its flights. Passengers can carry devices with up to 100Wh in cabin baggage, but they must be kept switched off during the flight. Charging devices using the power bank or charging the power bank itself onboard is prohibited. Like with Emirates, the power banks should also be stored in the seat pocket or under the seat in front of you.

The cancellations, affecting flights UAE707 and UAE708, come as protests over power and water shortages in Madagascar led to the imposition of a curfew in the capital, Antananarivo. As a result, travelers between these two Indian Ocean destinations are facing significant disruptions, with the situation impacting not only the airline but also the tourism industries in Madagascar, Seychelles, and the UAE. Emirates Airlines (UAE) Cancels 3 Flights due to Civil Unrest in Madagascar This has been a difficult year for global travelers, and the trend of delayed or canceled flights is widespread and troubling. Recently, Emirates Airlines (UAE) canceled three crucial flights due to civil unrest in Madagascar. Here’s what is causing the disruption: cancelation of flights UAE707 and UAE708 has brought difficulties to travelers in the Seychelles-Madagascar corridor. Multiple travelers seeking routes to either of these two Indian Ocean nations indicates that the direct impact on travelers is a sign of a larger problem that is primarily the lost business potential in the tourism sector for the UAE, Seychelles, and Madagascar. Cancellations Due to Civil Unrest in Madagascar The cause of unrest is usually as the result of multiple issues, and in the case of Madagascar, it is of civil unrest for protest and balance of power issues. Recently imposed nightly curfews and other restrictions, brought on due to these civil issues and unrest, have brought attention to the Flights from Ivato International (TNR) in Madagascar to Seychelles International (SEZ) as a safety measure. A decline in safety may trigger further escalation of the civil unrest.### Emirates Flights and Routes Cancellations: UAE707 and UAE708 The Emirates flights impacted are: UAE708 Route: Ivato International (TNR), Madagascar to Seychelles International (SEZ), Seychelles Scheduled Departure: Saturday, 6:45 PM EAT UAE707 Route: Seychelles International (SEZ), Seychelles to Ivato International (TNR), Madagascar Scheduled Departure: Sunday, 3:15 PM +04 UAE708 (repeats on Sunday) Route: Ivato International (TNR), Madagascar to Seychelles International (SEZ), Seychelles Scheduled Departure: Sunday, 6:45 PM EAT What Customers Can Expect When it comes to these flight cancellations, for customers there is less inconvenience and more of a problem waiting to happen. Because of current civil unrest, Madagascar will leave many travelers and civil population bored, waiting, and even stranded to find other means of transport to reach their desired destination. Here is what customers can expect: Advertisement Little to No Possibility for Alternate and Rerouted Flights The flights between Seychelles and Madagascar have a one-way length with a low frequency, therefore a considerable number of people will be expected to be stranded and postponed for some time. Those impacted directly from the cancellations of UAE707 are expected to receive Emirates provided alternate flights, although this will largely depend on flight capacity and the traffic standing on those flights, which is more than likely to be at season peak. Stranded Travelers’ Challenges in Finding Accommodations Finding accommodations can be problematic for travelers in transit who have had their flights canceled. Ongoing protests and curfews in Madagascar can add challenges for travelers assessing the adequacy of potential lodging and transportation. Travelers should be ready for delays and maintain a positive attitude during their stretch of travel. Wait Times on Communication and Customer Services The volume of passengers impacted during this time will result in longer wait times on communication from the airline. While this remains the case for travelers and guests of the Emirates airline, they should also be more active in seeking communication and information from the Emirates online, including assessing the current status of their flights. The Impact on Tourism: Countries Affected The canceled flights contribute to unrest in Madagascar and have a direct and negative impact on the parts of the world where these countries are interconnected with the travel and tourism industry. All four countries heavily rely on tourism and are likely to be affected: Madagascar, the Seychelles, and the UAE. Impact on Madagascar’s Tourism Madagascar has always been a favorite destination for nature lovers and eco-tourist because of its beautiful ecological presentation. The unique flora and fauna of Madagascar, particularly the famous lemurs, draw a multitude of visitors every year. Nonetheless, due to the steep cost of traveling, lack of proper infrastructural arrangements and poorly managed political situations, Madagascar has had challenges in growing and maintaining a healthy tourism sector. The COVID-19 pandemic made situations worse with a sharp decline in international tourism. Ongoing political unrest, including riots, aggressive curfews, and roadblocks, has made the tourism situation in Madagascar even more challenging. These factors certainly impact local and international tourists’ mobility and freedom of movement in the country. The recent spurs of flight cancellations could scare tourists out of planning a trip to Madagascar for the time being, and the tourism sector may struggle to recover. Impact on Seychelles’ Tourism Travelers seeking peace and natural beauty are naturally attracted to Seychelles. With fine natural features, including beautiful beaches and calm, clear waters, the goals of Seychelles tourism are perfectly aligned with the strengths of this tourism industry. Like its counterpart and neighbor, Seychelles’ tourism suffered greatly due to the pandemic and, even now, with limited flights and travel arrangements, the country has been strategically attempting to recover from a decline in tourism. The Seychelles tourism industry may be negatively affected by flight cancellations to and from the country. Cancellations from major source markets, including Madagascar, will make it harder for tourists to come to the island and jeopardize the return of tourists. This, in turn, impacts hotels, tour operators, and other businesses dependent on international clientele. Losing more tourism revenue may further delay the country’s recovery, which is particularly concerning as it aspires to reclaim its once dominant rank as a premier tourism destination in the Indian Ocean. The UAE’s Role in the Tourism Equation Emirates Airlines has become an important actor in the tourism trade for both Madagascar and the Seychelles. Canceled flights by the UAE’s national carrier also impact the Seychelles. In addition to Covid-19 headwinds, the Emirates has historically facilitated the movement of tourists to Seychelles and Madagascar and flown routes to its Dubai hub. Dubai is a major global stopover point for international tourists. Emirates Airlines has made travel to Seychelles and Madagascar easy for tourists. Any disruption in service to these destinations can affect flight availability and in turn the stream of tourists into the UAE. Tourists may consider modifying their travel to the Seychelles and Madagascar, which may lead to a decline in the number of tourists to Dubai and the rest of the UAE. What to Do for Affected Travelers Here are recommendations for those whose flights have been canceled to avoid disruption. 1. Contact Emirates Reach out to Emirates to discuss your rebooking options. The airline might suggest alternate flights, perhaps on different airlines. If you can’t rebook on Emirates, you might try to find flights from other airlines on the same route. 2. Explore Other Means of Transport An option of transport could be the reason flights to Seychelles or Madagascar are unobtainable. It is indeed possible to reach the two countries by sea and land. Though it might be time consuming and difficult to attempt. Travelers might also consider other flights that connect to the Seychelles or Madagascar which are nearby countries like Mauritius or Reunion Island. 3. Check Your Insurance Coverage If you have travel insurance, it is worthwhile to check which travel insurance policy you have. Insurance policies usually cover the costs of canceled, delayed, or otherwise disrupted flights. They also cover some of the costs for rebooking tickets, shelter, and other necessary expenses. 4. Monitor the Situation Make sure to check the Emirates site, the Emirates app, or the Emirates social media accounts to receive the latest updates on their flights, their cancellations, and their changes. Having the most up to date information on your flight will allow you to make the best possible travel arrangements. How to Mitigate the Effects: The Role of Tourism Authorities To lessen the impact of cancellations, governments and tourism authorities of the affected countries need to collaborate. Madagascar and Seychelles should expand alternative transportation options, especially access by sea. Seychelles’ tourism authority has to continue the marketing campaign and promote the fact that the destination is safe, notwithstanding the interruptions to travel. The UAE is expected to continue supporting tourism by maintaining strong air connections with the rest of the world and making sure that tourists and travelers can access key points in Dubai and the UAE. Emirates Airlines (UAE) has canceled three flights between Madagascar and Seychelles due to ongoing civil unrest in Madagascar. The cancellations, affecting flights UAE707 and UAE708, are disrupting travel between these key Indian Ocean destinations. Navigating Uncertainty in Travel Flight cancellations can easily impact the tourism industry and individual tourists. Although they can recover from the economic impact of the disruptions, countries like Madagascar and Seychelles rely heavily on international tourism and these countries will need to make the effort to communicate with travelers. For the time being, travelers need to be informed and take the initiative and plan around the challenges. The unpredictable nature of the situation will challenge the industry to keep communicating with travelers in order to foster the adaptability of the tourism sectors. Civil unrest in Madagascar could be a major issue for travelers planning to visit Seychelles or Madagascar. However, most travelers will be able to continue their trips with a little patience and preparation.

https://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/etihad-emirates-update-uae-travellers-as-cyberattack-hits-europe-airports-1.500276852#,"Etihad, Emirates update UAE travellers as cyberattack hits major European airports",,"Check-in and boarding disruptions hit flights at Brussels, Berlin, and Heathrow airports Major European airports , including Brussels, Berlin, and London Heathrow, faced cyber-related disruptions on Saturday, affecting automated check-in and baggage drop systems and leading to flight delays and cancellations. Etihad Airways reported longer-than-usual check-in times at affected airports following the cyberattack. “To help minimise delays to Etihad services, our staff are assisting guests with their check-in. Technicians are actively working to restore systems to normal operation as quickly as possible. We apologise for the delay due to circumstances beyond our control,” the airline said in a statement to Gulf News . At London Heathrow, Etihad confirmed that check-in systems were affected and urged passengers to arrive early. “Our staff are assisting guests with their check-in, and technicians are working to restore normal operations. We apologise for any delays caused by this technical issue,” the airline added. Meanwhile, Emirates Airline confirmed its operations were not significantly impacted by the cyberattack. Passengers were advised to check in online where possible and allow extra time for manual processing. Brussels Airport reported that the attack, which occurred Friday night, targeted a service provider affecting multiple European airports, forcing staff to rely on manual check-in and boarding. At least 10 flights were cancelled and 17 delayed by over an hour. Eurocontrol asked airlines to cancel half of Brussels’ flights between 4:00 am GMT Saturday and 2:00 am GMT Sunday. Heathrow also reported delays due to a technical issue, while Berlin Airport warned of longer waiting times at check-in. Airport service provider Collins Aerospace confirmed the issue, noting that electronic check-in and baggage drop systems were affected but that manual operations could mitigate the impact. Airports worldwide, from Japan to Germany, have increasingly faced disruptions due to cyberattacks and technical outages, as air travel becomes more reliant on interconnected systems. According to a June report by Thales, cyberattacks on the aviation sector surged 600% from 2024 to 2025. The report warned that every part of the aviation chain—from airlines and airports to navigation systems and suppliers—is vulnerable, making the sector a prime target for cyberattacks. Notable incidents include: Qantas (July 2024): Hackers accessed data on six million customers. Japan Airlines (December 2024): Targeted by cyber intrusions. Global IT crash (July 2024): Widespread airport disruptions, some halting flights and others relying on manual check-ins, causing long queues and delays.

https://simpleflying.com/why-emirates-order-boeing-777x/,Why In The World Did Emirates Order The Boeing 777X And Not More Airbus A350s?,,"Almost every airline with long-haul operations has ordered either the Boeing 787-9 or Airbus A350-900 . While the 787-9 is the more successful of the two, the A350-900 has also seen incredible sales, and most notably, has received more than double the orders of the Boeing 777-200ER, the aircraft that it is intended to directly succeed. These two aircraft have undoubtedly captured what is the "" sweet spot "" of the widebody market today, size-wise.  Emirates is one of the largest long-haul airlines in the entire world, with an all-widebody fleet of over 250 aircraft. Rather unsurprisingly, it currently operates the A350-900, with nine examples in service and 56 remaining on order for a total of 65. However, it also has orders for over 200 Boeing 777X aircraft. This plane is larger than the A350, with less range and fewer overall customers than the A350. Why is Emirates committing so heavily to the 777X? The Airbus A350 is one of three aircraft types operated by Emirates, alongside the Boeing 777 and Airbus A380. All of Emirates' A350 orders are for the A350-900, which is the smallest aircraft that the airline operates today. The Dubai-based carrier also operates similarly-sized Boeing 777-200LRs, but only 10 of them, and it flies 119 Boeing 777-300ERs. Additionally, it flies 116 Airbus A380s, by far the largest operator of the type. The A350s are mainly for growth rather than to replace Boeing 777s. Emirates relies on its A380s and 777-300ERs, but both of these aircraft are massive, and as such, there are many destinations where Emirates is either providing too much capacity or simply isn't able to serve economically. The A350-900, being smaller and far more efficient, should allow Emirates to greatly expand its network and improve the economics of its more marginal routes. Not only does Emirates have the A350 and 777X on order, but it also holds orders for 35 Boeing 787s. Rather uniquely, this order is split between 20 787-8s and 15 787-10s. Emirates tends to operate large aircraft fleets, making this Dreamliner subfleet uniquely small. Additionally, the 787-8 and 787-10 are both relatively uncommon compared to the 787-9, which has sold nearly 1,400 examples on its own. Yet, Emirates has ordered zero 787-9s . Emirates initially ordered the A350-900 at the Dubai Airshow in 2007, with initial deliveries scheduled for 2014. The A350-900 wouldn't enter service until early 2015, and Emirates' order also included the A350-1000. However, the carrier ended up canceling this order in 2014 and wouldn't order A350s again until 2019. These came as part of an agreement to cancel Airbus A380s (and for Airbus to discontinue the A380 program as a whole). Emirates was one of the initial customers for the Boeing 777X , ordering 150 examples at the 2013 Dubai Airshow, and it has grown its orderbook to 205 examples today. As such, Emirates' 777X order actually predates the current A350 order, and on top of that, 170 of its 205 777X orders are for the larger 777-9 model. Not only is the 777-9 the largest model of the 777X family, but it is also the largest airliner currently in production. Emirates Orderbook Number Airbus A350-900 56 (Nine In Service) Boeing 777-8 35 Boeing 777-9 170 Boeing 787-8 20 Boeing 787-9 15 Emirates' A350 order appears to be more of an opportunistic buy that came at a time when Airbus was debating whether to continue A380 production. After discussions, Emirates agreed to drop its remaining A380 orders and convert them to 40 A330-900s and 30 A350-900s, later changing the A330s to more A350s. In contrast, the 777X has always been a part of the airline's long-term strategy and is poised to become the backbone of the Emirates fleet. The relatively small Boeing 787-9 and Airbus A350-900 are the world's two most popular widebodies by far. The two aircraft have hit the sweet spot in the market, as they offer incredible capability while also being relatively low-risk due to their modest size. Whereas the 777-300ER received over 800 orders and was the most popular 777 variant by far, the A350-900 has dramatically outsold both the A350-1000 and the 777-9. Most airlines are building large fleets of A350-900s and 787-9s, while the A350-1000/777-300ER/777-9 fleets are smaller and serve as a ""flagship"". Emirates, however, is a little different. Emirates has built its entire business model around moving high volumes of passengers around the world through its hub in Dubai. It has mastered economies of scale in its Dubai hub, achieving lower unit costs, allowing it to offer competitive fares while simultaneously maintaining a pristine brand image. Aircraft Total Orders Boeing 787-9 1,381 Airbus A350-900 1,009 Boeing 777-9 449 Boeing 787-8 427 Boeing 787-10 398 Airbus A350-1000 361 Boeing 777-8 43 While the large size of the 777-9 occasionally makes it a hard sell, the extra seats compared to the 777-300ER make it perfect for Emirates. Dubai International Airport is constrained, so the only practical way for Emirates to significantly grow its network is to move from the 777-300ER to the 777-9. Going with more A350s would require Emirates to maintain the same capacity (with the A350-1000) or downgauge (with the A350-900). The Boeing 777-9 was designed with input from Emirates, Etihad Airways , and Qatar Airways in mind, and as such, the program has been rewarded with large orders from all three carriers. The three carriers' hubs in the Middle East (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha, respectively) present unique operational challenges due to the region's climate. The three airports are extremely dry and routinely experience high temperatures, which degrade aircraft performance. The 777X comes with a larger wing and a larger fuselage. As such, it's designed to move a high volume of passengers on long-haul and ultra-long-haul flights. But what's most important for the Middle Eastern carriers is the new General Electric GE9X engines. These are the largest turbofan engines ever made, and are essentially a blend of the powerful General Electric GE90-115B and the more efficient General Electric GEnx engines. The GE9X set a record for the most amount of thrust ever produced from an engine when it produced over 134,000 lbs of thrust during testing . However, the engine is only rated to produce 110,000 lbs of thrust in service. What this means in a practical sense is that the engine is not very stressed, which is incredibly important for reliability and durability. Emirates, meanwhile, has expressed reservations about the durability of the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines on the competing A350-1000. Emirates is the largest operator of the Airbus A380 by far, with 116 examples as of 2025. It's a key component of the carrier's fleet strategy, and it's expected to remain in service until the 2040s. Unfortunately for Emirates, there is no aircraft in service or in development that can match the A380's capacity, which represents a major issue for Emirates, seeing as how Dubai International is nearing its maximum capacity. The Boeing 777-9 , while still smaller in comparison, is the closest match to the A380 today. For an airline that is so heavily focused on volume, it represents the best solution to replace the superjumbo as of now. Although the fleet itself is meant to stay in service for almost two more decades, it's highly likely that the fleet will shrink over time. The most logical replacement for these older A380s is the 777X. Emirates may replace some of its older 777s with A350s or 787-10s, but what's most likely is that the 777X will serve as both a 777 and A380 replacement. For Emirates, the 777X will soon prove to be its most important aircraft. While the airline will eventually become one of the world's largest A350 operators, it's the 777X that will become the face of the airline. Airlines usually operate more A350-900s than they do A350-1000s or 777s, but Emirates is the other way around. The A350 is essentially for niche markets in Emirates' network, and while it certainly has enough demand to sustain a large fleet of these planes, it's not the carrier's primary aircraft. Instead, it'll be the 777X that will become the mainstay of the Emirates fleet, replacing all of its Boeing 777-300ER aircraft and likely at least part of the A380 fleet. The 777X, with its immense size and excellent fuel efficiency, is the ideal aircraft for Emirates. As the carrier grows, improves profits, and modernizes its fleet, it will continue to solidify its position as an icon of the modern airline industry. While the airline is best known for its A380 fleet today, it will soon be the 777X that will become almost ubiquitous with the airline. We want to hear from you! Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Your comment has not been saved  Why in the world does Simple Flying still use that silly headline? Don't they realize we are all making fun of them? WHY IN THE WORLD are you alienating a long-time reader with infantile headlines? ...Now, I don't have to read this, and that may be a good thing. Same here. I just stopped by to concur with you. The authors do not read any of our comments Then he won't read that I did his mother last night Clickbaity titles suck.... Baby gibberish...... This sites typical story continues it's race to the bottom and soon the headline ""why the heck are airplane tires not square"" will be story Timothy True to the motto: “You can’t reinvent the wheel,” as it always stays round, and also the article title remains the same ""Why In The World..."" ﻿😎﻿ Maybe the airline has some managers who know what they are doing?  It is a very successful and profitable airline. Let's lighten up on simple flying and unpack this story. The important thing to remember the A350 is a smaller airplane than the 777x.  Airbus was still building the A380 when they launched the A350 it was sized between the 787 and 777. When comparing the A350 to the 777-9 the cabins overlap in size but there is a huge difference in the wing. Next is engine thrust. The GE9X will certify at 110K but has been run at 134K. That leaves a lot of room for weight growth in the 777x. The A350 is close to being maxed out with the -1000. Things are going to get interesting once the -9 starts getting into the hands of the airlines. The large end of the market will become defined and Boeing will be well positioned to meet that market. Airbus will be forced to respond. Stay tuned. To make Doland happy, he may even block aircrafts not made in US to enter USA, after his tariff terrorism. What a strange article.  I can remember Leahy offering a second stretched A350 to Emirates, but Emirates declined!  And now the 777X suppose to be the latest and greatest?  R&R is the weak link in the Airbus economy, and its new CEO has worsened Airbus's position in the Middle East.  The XWB-97 has weaknesses like sand crystals melting into the super hot turbine blades.  I wonder what impact the technology pack for the XWB-97 will have for selling more A35Ks into the middle east.  Maybe it's also time for Airbus and shake off their lazy attitude toward an optimized wing for the A350.  The aspect ratio could be higher, the slackers in Toulouse would apply news technology to the A350 wing.  Still, I'm puzzled by Emirates large 777X order.  They declined a real clean sheet design from Airbus with a similar seat count, but better economics.  Now they ordered the 777X hack with composite wing and alloy fuselage, what is clearly a generation behind the full composite A350. Looking at the political situation in the Middle East with the islamic regime of Iran on one side of the Red Sea and the authoritarian Sheek regimes on the other side with the US Navy in-between protecting the Sheeks it's not all to far fetched to consider the Boeing orders as quid-pro-quo deals for protection services performed and AI-Technology as well as technology for fossil fuel exploration delivered.  Bottom line, it's always possible to find a technological sound justification to explain things, that would be to painful, if the real reason behind the geopolitical dealings between governments would come to light.  In this sense let the forum people believe, that technological superiority was the deciding factor for ordering the 777X.  The fact, that almost the whole US aerospace industry benefits from a Boeing mega factory running at capacity and the economic boost for the US economy during a hard time after COVID is a complete other story.  Long live DJT and his art of the deal. SNO  While other variables likely exist, the Trent engine's 97,000 lbf thrust output is notably lower than the 110,000 lbf of the GE9X and GE90. This thrust difference limits the operational flexibility for derate or assumed temperature settings in hot regions (e.g., the Middle East), which could rapidly accelerate engine wear and increase maintenance costs. It is a reasonable assumption that Rolls-Royce will leverage its sole-source position on the A350 to maintain high service fees. Gerry  Really, then let me say it so:  Emirates ordered the 777X garbage as a trade for protection services delivered by the US Navy.  Do you get that? ""Maybe it's also time for Airbus and shake off their lazy attitude toward an optimized wing for the A350. The aspect ratio could be higher, the slackers in Toulouse would apply news technology to the A350 wing.""  I never heard this before, how could the wings be optimized? SNO Unless you have receipts I don't believe you. Point me to where you got that information. Google for the expression ""Induced Drag"".  Total drag is the sum of parasitic drag and induced drag.  The energy required to create the vortices at the wing tips is leading to induced drag. Induced drag depends on the AoA of the wing.  The higher the AoA the higher the induced drag.  Induced drag can be less than 10% of the total drag during travel at altitude and it can be as much as 70% during phases at high AoA. Induced drag is indirect proportional to the aspect ratio of the wing.  The higher the aspect ratio, the lower the induced drag.  All the different shapes of wing tips are designed to reduce induced drag. The A330neo has an aspect ration around 11:1, 787-8 around 10.5:1, 787-9/10 around 9.5:1, 777X around 10:1, A359 around 9.5:1, and A35K around 9:1.  In other words Airbus knows, how to design a high efficient high aspect wing.  It wouldn't hurt to apply the latest knowledge at the wing of the A35K. Iran and all Emirates on the Red Sea ?  Did you get that from Truth Social ?",almost every airline with long haul operations has ordered either the boeing 787 9 or airbus a350 900 while the 787 9 is the more successful of the two the a350 900 has also seen incredible sales and most notably has received more than double the orders of the boeing 777 200er the aircraft that it is intended to directly succeed these two aircraft have undoubtedly captured what is the sweet spot of the widebody market today size wise emirates is one of the largest long haul airlines in the entire world with an all widebody fleet of over 250 aircraft rather unsurprisingly it currently operates the a350 900 with nine examples in service and 56 remaining on order for a total of 65 however it also has orders for over 200 boeing 777x aircraft this plane is larger than the a350 with less range and fewer overall customers than the a350 why is emirates committing so heavily to the 777x the airbus a350 is one of three aircraft types operated by emirates alongside the boeing 777 and airbus a380 all of emirates a350 orders are for the a350 900 which is the smallest aircraft that the airline operates today the dubai based carrier also operates similarly sized boeing 777 200lrs but only 10 of them and it flies 119 boeing 777 300ers additionally it flies 116 airbus a380s by far the largest operator of the type the a350s are mainly for growth rather than to replace boeing 777s emirates relies on its a380s and 777 300ers but both of these aircraft are massive and as such there are many destinations where emirates is either providing too much capacity or simply isn t able to serve economically the a350 900 being smaller and far more efficient should allow emirates to greatly expand its network and improve the economics of its more marginal routes not only does emirates have the a350 and 777x on order but it also holds orders for 35 boeing 787s rather uniquely this order is split between 20 787 8s and 15 787 10s emirates tends to operate large aircraft fleets making this dreamliner subfleet uniquely small additionally the 787 8 and 787 10 are both relatively uncommon compared to the 787 9 which has sold nearly 1 400 examples on its own yet emirates has ordered zero 787 9s emirates initially ordered the a350 900 at the dubai airshow in 2007 with initial deliveries scheduled for 2014 the a350 900 wouldn t enter service until early 2015 and emirates order also included the a350 1000 however the carrier ended up canceling this order in 2014 and wouldn t order a350s again until 2019 these came as part of an agreement to cancel airbus a380s and for airbus to discontinue the a380 program as a whole emirates was one of the initial customers for the boeing 777x ordering 150 examples at the 2013 dubai airshow and it has grown its orderbook to 205 examples today as such emirates 777x order actually predates the current a350 order and on top of that 170 of its 205 777x orders are for the larger 777 9 model not only is the 777 9 the largest model of the 777x family but it is also the largest airliner currently in production emirates orderbook number airbus a350 900 56 nine in service boeing 777 8 35 boeing 777 9 170 boeing 787 8 20 boeing 787 9 15 emirates a350 order appears to be more of an opportunistic buy that came at a time when airbus was debating whether to continue a380 production after discussions emirates agreed to drop its remaining a380 orders and convert them to 40 a330 900s and 30 a350 900s later changing the a330s to more a350s in contrast the 777x has always been a part of the airline s long term strategy and is poised to become the backbone of the emirates fleet the relatively small boeing 787 9 and airbus a350 900 are the world s two most popular widebodies by far the two aircraft have hit the sweet spot in the market as they offer incredible capability while also being relatively low risk due to their modest size whereas the 777 300er received over 800 orders and was the most popular 777 variant by far the a350 900 has dramatically outsold both the a350 1000 and the 777 9 most airlines are building large fleets of a350 900s and 787 9s while the a350 1000 777 300er 777 9 fleets are smaller and serve as a flagship emirates however is a little different emirates has built its entire business model around moving high volumes of passengers around the world through its hub in dubai it has mastered economies of scale in its dubai hub achieving lower unit costs allowing it to offer competitive fares while simultaneously maintaining a pristine brand image aircraft total orders boeing 787 9 1 381 airbus a350 900 1 009 boeing 777 9 449 boeing 787 8 427 boeing 787 10 398 airbus a350 1000 361 boeing 777 8 43 while the large size of the 777 9 occasionally makes it a hard sell the extra seats compared to the 777 300er make it perfect for emirates dubai international airport is constrained so the only practical way for emirates to significantly grow its network is to move from the 777 300er to the 777 9 going with more a350s would require emirates to maintain the same capacity with the a350 1000 or downgauge with the a350 900 the boeing 777 9 was designed with input from emirates etihad airways and qatar airways in mind and as such the program has been rewarded with large orders from all three carriers the three carriers hubs in the middle east dubai abu dhabi and doha respectively present unique operational challenges due to the region s climate the three airports are extremely dry and routinely experience high temperatures which degrade aircraft performance the 777x comes with a larger wing and a larger fuselage as such it s designed to move a high volume of passengers on long haul and ultra long haul flights but what s most important for the middle eastern carriers is the new general electric ge9x engines these are the largest turbofan engines ever made and are essentially a blend of the powerful general electric ge90 115b and the more efficient general electric genx engines the ge9x set a record for the most amount of thrust ever produced from an engine when it produced over 134 000 lbs of thrust during testing however the engine is only rated to produce 110 000 lbs of thrust in service what this means in a practical sense is that the engine is not very stressed which is incredibly important for reliability and durability emirates meanwhile has expressed reservations about the durability of the rolls royce trent xwb 97 engines on the competing a350 1000 emirates is the largest operator of the airbus a380 by far with 116 examples as of 2025 it s a key component of the carrier s fleet strategy and it s expected to remain in service until the 2040s unfortunately for emirates there is no aircraft in service or in development that can match the a380 s capacity which represents a major issue for emirates seeing as how dubai international is nearing its maximum capacity the boeing 777 9 while still smaller in comparison is the closest match to the a380 today for an airline that is so heavily focused on volume it represents the best solution to replace the superjumbo as of now although the fleet itself is meant to stay in service for almost two more decades it s highly likely that the fleet will shrink over time the most logical replacement for these older a380s is the 777x emirates may replace some of its older 777s with a350s or 787 10s but what s most likely is that the 777x will serve as both a 777 and a380 replacement for emirates the 777x will soon prove to be its most important aircraft while the airline will eventually become one of the world s largest a350 operators it s the 777x that will become the face of the airline airlines usually operate more a350 900s than they do a350 1000s or 777s but emirates is the other way around the a350 is essentially for niche markets in emirates network and while it certainly has enough demand to sustain a large fleet of these planes it s not the carrier s primary aircraft instead it ll be the 777x that will become the mainstay of the emirates fleet replacing all of its boeing 777 300er aircraft and likely at least part of the a380 fleet the 777x with its immense size and excellent fuel efficiency is the ideal aircraft for emirates as the carrier grows improves profits and modernizes its fleet it will continue to solidify its position as an icon of the modern airline industry while the airline is best known for its a380 fleet today it will soon be the 777x that will become almost ubiquitous with the airline

leaves a lot of room for weight growth in the 777x the a350 is close to being maxed out with the 1000 things are going to get interesting once the 9 starts getting into the hands of the airlines the

aircraft that the airline operates today the dubai based carrier also operates similarly sized boeing 777 200lrs but only 10 of them and it flies 119 boeing 777 300ers additionally it flies 116 airbus a380s by far the largest operator of the type the a350s are mainly for growth rather than to replace boeing 777s emirates relies on its a380s and 777 300ers but both of these aircraft are massive and as such there are many destinations where emirates is either providing too much capacity or simply isn t able to serve economically the a350 900 being smaller and far more efficient should allow emirates to greatly expand its network and improve the economics of its more marginal routes not only does emirates have the a350 and 777x on order but it also holds orders for 35 boeing 787s rather uniquely this order is split between 20 787 8s and 15 787 10s emirates tends to operate large aircraft fleets making this dreamliner subfleet uniquely small additionally the 787 8 and 787 10 are both relatively uncommon compared to the 787 9 which has sold nearly 1 400 examples on its own yet emirates has ordered zero 787 9s emirates initially ordered the a350 900 at the dubai airshow in 2007 with initial deliveries scheduled for 2014 the a350 900 wouldn t enter service until early 2015 and emirates order also included the a350 1000 however the carrier ended up canceling this order in 2014 and wouldn t order a350s again until 2019 these came as part of an agreement to cancel airbus a380s and for airbus to discontinue the a380 program as a whole emirates was one of the initial customers for the boeing 777x ordering 150 examples at the 2013 dubai airshow and it has grown its orderbook to 205 examples today as such emirates 777x order actually predates the current a350 order and on top of that 170 of its 205 777x orders are for the larger 777 9 model not only is the 777 9 the largest model of the 777x family but it is also the largest airliner currently in production emirates orderbook number airbus a350 900 56 nine in service boeing 777 8 35 boeing 777 9 170 boeing 787 8 20 boeing 787 9 15 emirates a350 order appears to be more of an opportunistic buy that came at a time when airbus was debating whether to continue a380 production after discussions emirates agreed to drop its remaining a380 orders and convert them to 40 a330 900s and 30 a350 900s later changing the a330s to more a350s in contrast the 777x has always been a part of the airline s long term strategy and is poised to become the backbone of the emirates fleet the relatively small boeing 787 9 and airbus a350 900 are the world s two most popular widebodies by far the two aircraft have hit the sweet spot in the market as they offer incredible capability while also being relatively low risk due to their modest size whereas the 777 300er received over 800 orders and was the most popular 777 variant by far the a350 900 has dramatically outsold both the a350 1000 and the 777 9 most airlines are building large fleets of a350 900s and 787 9s while the a350 1000 777 300er 777 9 fleets are smaller and serve as a flagship emirates however is a little different emirates has built its entire business model around moving high volumes of passengers around the world through its hub in dubai it has mastered economies of scale in its dubai hub achieving lower unit costs allowing it to offer competitive fares while simultaneously maintaining a pristine brand image aircraft total orders boeing 787 9 1 381 airbus a350 900 1 009 boeing 777 9 449 boeing 787 8 427 boeing 787 10 398 airbus a350 1000 361 boeing 777 8 43 while the large size of the 777 9 occasionally makes it a hard sell the extra seats compared to the 777 300er make it perfect for emirates dubai international airport is constrained so the only practical way for emirates to significantly grow its network is to move from the 777 300er to the 777 9 going with more a350s would require emirates to maintain the same capacity with the a350 1000 or downgauge with the a350 900 the boeing 777 9 was designed with input from emirates etihad airways and qatar airways in mind and as such the program has been rewarded with large orders from all three carriers the three carriers hubs in the middle east dubai abu dhabi and doha respectively present unique operational challenges due to the region s climate the three airports are extremely dry and routinely experience high temperatures which degrade aircraft performance the 777x comes with a larger wing and a larger fuselage as such it s designed to move a high volume of passengers on long haul and ultra long haul flights but what s most important for the middle eastern carriers is the new general electric ge9x engines these are the largest turbofan engines ever made and are essentially a blend of the powerful general electric ge90 115b and the more efficient general electric genx engines the ge9x set a record for the most amount of thrust ever produced from an engine when it produced over 134 000 lbs of thrust during testing however the engine is only rated to produce 110 000 lbs of thrust in service what this means in a practical sense is that the engine is not very stressed which is incredibly important for reliability and durability emirates meanwhile has expressed reservations about the durability of the rolls royce trent xwb 97 engines on the competing a350 1000 emirates is the largest operator of the airbus a380 by far with 116 examples as of 2025 it s a key component of the carrier s fleet strategy and it s expected to remain in service until the 2040s unfortunately for emirates there is no aircraft in service or in development that can match the a380 s capacity which represents a major issue for emirates seeing as how dubai international is nearing its maximum capacity the boeing 777 9 while still smaller in comparison is the closest match to the a380 today for an airline that is so heavily focused on volume it represents the best solution to replace the superjumbo as of now although the fleet itself is meant to stay in service for almost two more decades it s highly likely that the fleet will shrink over time the most logical replacement for these older a380s is the 777x emirates may replace some of its older 777s with a350s or 787 10s but what s most likely is that the 777x will serve as both a 777 and a380 replacement for emirates the 777x will soon prove to be its most important aircraft while the airline will eventually become one of the world s largest a350 operators it s the 777x that will become the face of the airline airlines usually operate more a350 900s than they do a350 1000s or 777s but emirates is the other way around the a350 is essentially for niche markets in emirates network and while it certainly has enough demand to sustain a large fleet of these planes it s not the carrier s primary aircraft instead it ll be the 777x that will become the mainstay of the emirates fleet replacing all of its boeing 777 300er aircraft and likely at least part of the a380 fleet the 777x with its immense size and excellent fuel efficiency is the ideal aircraft for emirates as the carrier grows improves profits and modernizes its fleet it will continue to solidify its position as an icon of the modern airline industry while the airline is best known for its a380 fleet today it will soon be the 777x that will become almost ubiquitous with the airline we want to hear from you share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful your comment has not been saved why in the world does simple flying still use that silly headline don t they realize we are all making fun of them why in the world are you alienating a long time reader with infantile headlines now i don t have to read this and that may be a good thing same here i just stopped by to concur with you the authors do not read any of our comments then he won t read that i did his mother last night clickbaity titles suck baby gibberish this sites typical story continues it s race to the bottom and soon the headline why the heck are airplane tires not square will be story timothy true to the motto “ you can ’ t reinvent the wheel ” as it always stays round and also the article title remains the same why in the world ﻿﻿ maybe the airline has some managers who know what they are doing it is a very successful and profitable airline let s lighten up on simple flying and unpack this story the important thing to remember the a350 is a smaller airplane than the 777x airbus was still building the a380 when they launched the a350 it was sized between the 787 and 777 when comparing the a350 to the 777 9 the cabins overlap in size but there is a huge difference in the wing next is engine thrust the ge9x will certify at 110k but has been run at 134k that leaves a lot of room for weight growth in the 777x the a350 is close to being maxed out with the 1000 things are going to get interesting once the 9 starts getting into the hands of the airlines the large end of the market will become defined and boeing will be well positioned to meet that market airbus will be forced to respond stay tuned to make doland happy he may even block aircrafts not made in us to enter usa after his tariff terrorism what a strange article i can remember leahy offering a second stretched a350 to emirates but emirates declined and now the 777x suppose to be the latest and greatest r r is the weak link in the airbus economy and its new ceo has worsened airbus s position in the middle east the xwb 97 has weaknesses like sand crystals melting into the super hot turbine blades i wonder what impact the technology pack for the xwb 97 will have for selling more a35ks into the middle east maybe it s also time for airbus and shake off their lazy attitude toward an optimized wing for the a350 the aspect ratio could be higher the slackers in toulouse would apply news technology to the a350 wing still i m puzzled by emirates large 777x order they declined a real clean sheet design from airbus with a similar seat count but better economics now they ordered the 777x hack with composite wing and alloy fuselage what is clearly a generation behind the full composite a350 looking at the political situation in the middle east with the islamic regime of iran on one side of the red sea and the authoritarian sheek regimes on the other side with the us navy in between protecting the sheeks it s not all to far fetched to consider the boeing orders as quid pro quo deals for protection services performed and ai technology as well as technology for fossil fuel exploration delivered bottom line it s always possible to find a technological sound justification to explain things that would be to painful if the real reason behind the geopolitical dealings between governments would come to light in this sense let the forum people believe that technological superiority was the deciding factor for ordering the 777x the fact that almost the whole us aerospace industry benefits from a boeing mega factory running at capacity and the economic boost for the us economy during a hard time after covid is a complete other story long live djt and his art of the deal sno while other variables likely exist the trent engine s 97 000 lbf thrust output is notably lower than the 110 000 lbf of the ge9x and ge90 this thrust difference limits the operational flexibility for derate or assumed temperature settings in hot regions e g the middle east which could rapidly accelerate engine wear and increase maintenance costs it is a reasonable assumption that rolls royce will leverage its sole source position on the a350 to maintain high service fees gerry really then let me say it so emirates ordered the 777x garbage as a trade for protection services delivered by the us navy do you get that maybe it s also time for airbus and shake off their lazy attitude toward an optimized wing for the a350 the aspect ratio could be higher the slackers in toulouse would apply news technology to the a350 wing i never heard this before how could the wings be optimized sno unless you have receipts i don t believe you point me to where you got that information google for the expression induced drag total drag is the sum of parasitic drag and induced drag the energy required to create the vortices at the wing tips is leading to induced drag induced drag depends on the aoa of the wing the higher the aoa the higher the induced drag induced drag can be less than 10 of the total drag during travel at altitude and it can be as much as 70 during phases at high aoa induced drag is indirect proportional to the aspect ratio of the wing the higher the aspect ratio the lower the induced drag all the different shapes of wing tips are designed to reduce induced drag the a330neo has an aspect ration around 11 1 787 8 around 10 5 1 787 9 10 around 9 5 1 777x around 10 1 a359 around 9 5 1 and a35k around 9 1 in other words airbus knows how to design a high efficient high aspect wing it wouldn t hurt to apply the latest knowledge at the wing of the a35k iran and all emirates on the red sea did you get that from

https://simpleflying.com/emirates-longest-nonstop-routes-boeing-777-2025/,Emirates’ Longest Nonstop Routes With The Boeing 777 In 2025,,"Wikimedia Commons , Simple Flying Emirates remains one of the world’s largest operators of the Boeing 777 , and, in 2025, the twinjet continues to play a defining role in the carrier’s network. While the Airbus A380 often captures the spotlight as Emirates’ flagship, the 777 remains the workhorse of the airline. With its versatility, range, and reliability, the 777 serves destinations where the superjumbo would be either too large or operationally impractical.  Today, Emirates operates multiple variants of the Triple-Seven for different routes and reasons. It flies the Boeing 777-200LR , Boeing 777F , and Boeing777-300ER , although the latter is by far the most prominent in its fleet. These aircraft enable Emirates to reach secondary markets as well as central hubs, often covering routes stretching over 8,000 miles. Emirates operates the world’s largest Boeing 777 fleet, with over 140 active aircraft in 2025 . The bulk of this fleet consists of the 119 777-300ERs, a long-haul variant capable of seating more than 350 passengers in typical configurations. Alongside these, the airline also has a smaller number of 777-200LRs, which were primarily introduced to cover ultra-long-haul missions such as from Dubai to the United States . The airline has used the 777 extensively for more than two decades, steadily building a global network in which the aircraft is a backbone asset. The 777’s flexibility means it is equally comfortable flying shorter missions to South Asia as it is traversing transoceanic routes to North America or Australia. While Emirates is gradually preparing for the arrival of the next-generation 777X, its current fleet continues to drive much of the carrier’s daily operations. According to data from Cirium , an aviation analytics company, Emirates has deployed the Boeing 777 on routes that generate billions of available seat miles annually. These routes are especially important where the Airbus A380 cannot be justified, such as secondary US cities or thinner Oceania markets. The United States represents one of the most important regions for Emirates’ Boeing 777 operations. The airline connects Dubai to several American cities with flights that stretch well beyond 7,000 miles (11,000 km), utilizing the 777’s long-range capabilities. Dubai To Dallas/Fort Worth . This route is Emirates’ longest non-stop 777 service, covering 8,038 miles (12,936 km). It operates 366 times per year, providing 120,320 seats and generating 967 million ASMs. Dallas’s role as a logistics and aviation hub makes this one of Emirates’ most strategic US routes. Notably, Qatar Airways also operates flights from Doha to Dallas, creating strong Gulf competition in this long-haul sector. Dubai To Miami. At 7,844 miles (12,624 km), the DXB–MIA route is the second-longest 777 service. With 366 flights annually, it produces over 955 million ASMs. Miami’s strong Latin American connections make it a natural fit for Emirates’ global network. Etihad Airways , operating out of nearby Abu Dhabi, has not yet launched services to Miami, but Qatar Airways offers competition via Doha. Dubai To Orlando . Orlando ranks third among Emirates’ US 777 routes, spanning 7,754 miles (12,479 km). With 261 flights annually and more than 92,000 seats, this leisure-focused service capitalizes on Florida’s role as a tourism hub. Currently, Emirates has little direct competition for this specific city-pair, which makes Orlando unique compared to Miami or New York. Dubai To Seattle. Seattle’s route stretches 7,425 miles (11,949 km), operating 366 times annually with nearly 895 million ASMs generated. The Pacific Northwest’s technology and aerospace industries make it a valuable link for Emirates. Delta Air Lines has historically offered one-stop services to the Middle East via European partners, but Emirates’ nonstop option remains unmatched for convenience. Dubai To Chicago . Chicago O’Hare sits at 7,246 miles (11,661 km) from Dubai and receives 366 flights annually. With 118,548 seats and 859 million ASMs, it is one of the strongest 777 operations in the Midwest. Etihad also serves Chicago from Abu Dhabi , meaning travelers from the UAE have multiple Gulf carrier options for reaching the Windy City. Dubai To Boston . Finally, the Boston connection covers 6,663 miles (10,723 km), providing 120,028 seats annually across 366 flights. With 799 million ASMs, the route serves New England’s academic, biotech, and business communities. Qatar Airways is also a competitor, operating its own Doha–Boston service, while Emirates maintains a strong nonstop product from Dubai. Emirates also offers several flights to Canada, including a non-stop service from Dubai to Montréal on both the Boeing 777-300ER and 777-200LR. However, these routes are slightly shorter due to the North Pole route via Russia that Emirates uses. Therefore, no single city in Canada is included in the top ten longest routes. South America remains a challenging market for long-haul carriers, but Emirates has managed to establish a presence in Brazil. The Boeing 777 operates one of the airline’s longest flights to the region, namely from Dubai to Rio de Janeiro . At 7,383 miles (11,882 km), the DXB–GIG route is Emirates’ key 777 link to South America. It operates 280 times annually, offering nearly 100,000 seats and producing 734 million ASMs. This service complements Emirates’ São Paulo flights operated with an Airbus A380, while extending the airline’s reach into Brazil’s cultural capital. Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines also serve South America extensively, with flights to São Paulo and Buenos Aires, highlighting the competition Gulf and European carriers face in this long-haul market. Australia is a cornerstone of Emirates’ international network, serving as a major connecting hub for travelers between major European and Australian cities. The Boeing 777 plays an essential role in serving several major cities across the continent. Emirates also offers direct flights to neighboring New Zealand, which is further away, but an Airbus A380 is currently used for these flights. Dubai To Brisbane . Spanning 7,442 miles (11,977 km), this route is a vital link in Oceania. With 68 annual flights, it produces almost 179 million ASMs. Though less frequent than Sydney or Melbourne, Brisbane adds depth to Emirates’ Australian offering. Etihad also flies to Brisbane from Abu Dhabi, while Qatar Airways has established its own presence with flights from Doha to Brisbane. Dubai To Melbourne . Melbourne, at 7,230 miles (11,636 km), is served 278 times annually by the 777. With 90,080 seats offered, the route generates 651 million ASMs, reflecting Melbourne’s importance as Australia’s cultural hub. Melbourne also sees services from Qatar Airways, Etihad, and Singapore Airlines , making it one of the hottest long-haul markets in Oceania. Dubai To Adelaide . The Adelaide connection covers 6,834 miles (10,998 km), with 334 flights annually. Offering more than 100,000 seats and generating 689 million ASMs, this route ensures that South Australia is directly tied to the Middle East. Adelaide is less frequently served by Gulf rivals, giving Emirates a market exclusivity advantage. Emirates’ reliance on the Boeing 777 for ultra-long-haul services underscores the aircraft’s adaptability and economic efficiency. These flights connect Dubai to diverse markets, from US technology hubs to South American cultural centers and Australian metropolises. These routes also highlight Emirates’ strategy of diversification, ensuring connectivity beyond the traditional superjumbo routes. Beyond passengers, Emirates’ Boeing 777 network also transports a significant amount of cargo . The belly capacity of the 777-300ER is crucial for industries ranging from pharmaceuticals to electronics, especially on US routes where high-value goods are shipped both ways. Route Aircraft Type Flights Passengers Distance (miles) Distance (km) Dubai (DXB) – Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) 777-300ER 366 120,320 8,038 12,936 Dubai (DXB) – Miami (MIA) 777-300ER 366 121,758 7,844 12,624 Dubai (DXB) – Orlando (MCO) 777-300ER 261 92,394 7,754 12,479 Dubai (DXB) – Brisbane (BNE) 777-300ER 68 24,046 7,442 11,977 Dubai (DXB) – Seattle (SEA) 777-300ER 366 120,548 7,425 11,949 Dubai (DXB) – Rio de Janeiro (GIG) 777-300ER 280 99,474 7,383 11,882 Dubai (DXB) – Chicago (ORD) 777-300ER 366 118,548 7,246 11,661 Dubai (DXB) – Melbourne (MEL) 777-300ER 278 90,080 7,230 11,636 Dubai (DXB) – Adelaide (ADL) 777-200LR 334 100,868 6,834 10,998 Dubai (DXB) – Boston (BOS) 777-300ER 366 120,028 6,663 10,723 Routes like Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago, which are connected to the logistics and manufacturing sectors, see steady cargo demand. This cargo uplift helps balance the economics of ultra-long-haul flying, ensuring these services remain viable even during periods with fewer passengers. In fact, cargo revenue was a key reason why Emirates maintained operations during the pandemic, and the 777’s payload flexibility continues to support the airline’s global leadership today. Looking ahead, Emirates is preparing for the introduction of the Boeing 777X . With over 100 on order, the airline expects to deploy these next-generation jets on many of the ultra-long-haul missions currently operated by the 777-300ER. The 777X promises greater range, improved fuel efficiency, and enhanced passenger amenities. For routes such as Dubai to Dallas, Miami, and Brisbane, the aircraft will provide superior economics and payload capability. This will allow Emirates to solidify further its dominance in connecting Dubai to distant global markets. It is worth noting that neighboring Etihad and Qatar Airways are also poised to benefit from the next wave of long-haul twin-aisle jets. Etihad has committed to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner for many of its ultra-long-haul services but is keeping an eye on fleet modernization. Qatar Airways, meanwhile, has also ordered the 777X, ensuring that Gulf competition on routes to the United States and Australia will remain intense well into the 2030s. The backbone role of the Boeing 777 will soon pass to the 777X, but until then, the 777-300ER remains Emirates’ primary workhorse for some of the longest flights in the world.

steady cargo demand this cargo uplift helps balance the economics of ultra long haul flying ensuring these services remain viable even during periods with fewer passengers in fact cargo revenue was a key reason why emirates maintained operations during the pandemic and the 777 ’ s payload flexibility continues to support the airline ’ s global leadership today looking ahead emirates is preparing for the introduction of the boeing 777x with over 100 on order the airline expects to deploy these next generation jets on many of the ultra long haul missions currently operated by the 777 300er the 777x promises greater range improved fuel efficiency and enhanced passenger amenities for routes such as dubai to dallas miami and brisbane the aircraft will provide superior economics and payload capability this will allow emirates to solidify further its dominance in connecting dubai to distant global markets it is worth noting that neighboring etihad and qatar airways are also poised to benefit from the next wave of long haul twin aisle jets etihad has committed to the boeing 787 dreamliner for many of its ultra long haul services but is keeping an eye on fleet modernization qatar airways meanwhile has also ordered the 777x ensuring that gulf competition on routes to the united states and australia will remain intense well into the 2030s the backbone role of the boeing 777 will soon pass to the 777x but until then the 777 300er remains emirates ’ primary workhorse for some of the longest flights in the world we want to hear from you share your opinions in the thread below

On September 24, 2025, Antigua and Barbuda representatives confirmed discussions had taken place in Dubai with Adnan Kazim, the Deputy President and COO of Emirates . According to the Deputy Head of Mission of Antigua and Barbuda to the UAE, Theon Ali, and his team, talks “centered on the strategic value of Antigua and Barbuda as a gateway to the Eastern Caribbean”.

https://gulfnews.com/business/aviation/emirates-announces-major-change-for-passengers-on-all-flights-starting-today-1.500288571,Emirates announces major change for passengers on all flights,,"Using any kind of power bank is now prohibited onboard Emirates’ flights Dubai: Emirates’ safety rules for customer usage of power banks onboard flights is now in full effect, the UAE's national carrier reaffirmed on Tuesday. ""Using any kind of power bank is prohibited onboard Emirates’ flights, effective from tomorrow, October 1, 2025,"" it said in a statement. ""Emirates provides in-seat charging on all aircraft, however, still recommends that customers fully charge their devices before flying, especially on longer duration flights."" The airline said the rule applies across its entire fleet after a safety review highlighted risks linked to lithium battery incidents in aviation. Passengers may carry one power bank under 100Wh. Power banks cannot be used to charge devices onboard. Passengers cannot recharge power banks using the aircraft’s power supply. All power banks must display capacity rating information. Power banks must be kept in the seat pocket or under the seat, not in overhead bins. Power banks remain prohibited in checked baggage. Emirates noted that while its aircraft already provide in-seat charging ports, travelers should fully charge their devices before flying, especially on long-haul journeys. The airline said rising use of portable chargers has coincided with a growing number of lithium battery-related incidents across the aviation industry. Power banks, typically powered by lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries, pose a fire hazard if damaged or overcharged. In severe cases, a process known as thermal runaway can lead to overheating, fires, or explosions. By banning their use onboard and requiring passengers to store them in easily accessible areas, Emirates said it can ensure cabin crew can quickly respond to any emergency. Emirates emphasized that safety remains its top operational priority. The airline said the new rules are designed to minimize risks and enhance passenger safety while maintaining comfort with built-in charging options at every seat.

https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business/aviation/emirates-power-bank-ban-reminder,Emirates power bank ban comes into effect on October 1; airline issues reminder | Khaleej Times,2025-06-10,"Tue, Sep 30, 2025 | Rabi al-Thani 8, 1447 | Fajr 04:54 | DXB 35°C. It is aimed at minimizing risks associated with lithium battery-powered devices. Emirates is reminding passengers that the use of power banks will be prohibited onboard all its flights starting tomorrow, October 1, 2025. While travelers may still carry one power bank under specific conditions, the airline has reiterated that the devices may not be used at any time during the flight. The reminder comes ahead of the implementation of new safety regulations first announced earlier this year, aimed at minimising risks associated with lithium battery-powered devices. Under the rules: only one power bank under 100 Watt Hours is permitted per passenger; power banks may not be used to charge personal devices during the flight; charging power banks using the aircraft’s power supply is not allowed; devices must be clearly labeled with capacity ratings; power banks must be stored in the seat pocket or under the seat — not in overhead bins; and power banks remain banned in checked baggage. Emirates noted that in-seat charging remains available on all aircraft, but still encourages passengers to fully charge their devices before boarding, especially for long-haul flights. The airline says the move follows a detailed safety review amid a rise in incidents involving lithium batteries across the aviation industry. Power banks, which typically use lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, can pose a fire hazard if damaged, poorly manufactured, or overcharged. Emirates emphasized that the decision to prohibit their use inflight is a proactive measure to ensure rapid response in the rare event of battery failure or fire. Keeping the devices accessible — but unused — allows cabin crew to respond quickly if needed. “Safety remains the foundation of everything we do,” the airline said in a statement. “These measures are designed to protect our passengers, crew, and aircraft at all times.”",tue sep 30 2025 rabi al thani 8 1447 fajr 04 54 dxb 35°c it is aimed at minimizing risks associated with lithium battery powered
